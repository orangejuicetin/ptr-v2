However, Rajiv has a hidden energy - one that allows him to memorize all students&rsquo; names across 200-person classes and one that materializes as he teaches Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (CIS 160) and Algorithms and Data Structures (CIS 121) at the University of Pennsylvania. We sat down with Professor Gandhi to learn more about his childhood, his path to academia, his advice to students, and more.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">We asked, &ldquo;Rajiv, if you didn&rsquo;t go down the computer science path, what do you think you&rsquo;d be doing?&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 16pt;\"><em>&ldquo;Table tennis.&rdquo;</em> </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"color: #2b2b2b;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">Yes, Rajiv Gandhi was a table tennis enthusiast in his childhood days. In fact, with hard work and dedication, Rajiv ranked 6th nationally at the age of 14. He practiced hours each day and even inspired others in his town to be competitively involved with the sport. He added, </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;I wanted to help other players achieve success in table tennis. When I was young and started playing, there was no one in my vicinity playing table tennis, but once I started, about 10 to 12 kids in my immediate locality started playing. I would say that I had a small part to play in inspiring them to take up the sport.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">A drive to help others is a common theme we see throughout our conversation with Professor Gandhi; it purposes his strong work ethic. Although he was obsessed with the sport, Rajiv&rsquo;s parents encouraged him to focus on his academics; eventually, he had to quit. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\">Rajiv then applied his strong work ethic to academics. After completing his bachelor's in India, he came to the United States, completed a master&rsquo;s in computer networking, and then worked at Qualcomm. Rajiv mentioned, &ldquo;it became very clear after being in </span>industry<span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\"> that I wanted to go into academia.&rdquo; Naturally, we questioned what initially drew Rajiv to computer science, to a Ph.D. in the field, and eventually to instruction. His answer caught us a bit off-guard:</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;You see, my life was, in a way, simple. I used to envy people like you in America who had so many choices in life. I didn&rsquo;t have many choices. I was told &lsquo;You have to become an engineer.&rsquo; If you&rsquo;ve seen the movie Three Idiots, I was one of those - whose life was scripted. I was told &lsquo;Hey, you have to be an engineer. Then you have to go to the U.S., get a masters degree&rsquo; and so forth. But, it worked out well for me because I&rsquo;m not the kind of person that thinks too much. &lsquo;Oh do I like this? Do I not like this? Is this for me?&rsquo; Those questions never came to me.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\">Professor Gandhi&rsquo;s intense focus, work ethic, and perseverance allow him to excel in any endeavor. Whether it's playing table tennis or engaging students in complex mathematical proofs, he&rsquo;s someone who takes the cards he&rsquo;s dealt and plays his absolute best game. We were still curious - how did Rajiv&rsquo;s philosophy guide his passion for studying computer science?</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;I came into the master&rsquo;s program with zero computer science knowledge. Imagine, I was a master&rsquo;s student sitting with 17-year olds in introductory computer science courses; I had a tough time with the subjects I teach now - algorithms, proofs, and induction. Then, I started my job at Qualcomm, who, at the time, offered opportunities for employees to take courses at UCSD. Having completed my formal education, I wanted to use this opportunity to go back to school and fill some holes in my knowledge. I used to study because I wanted to get an A. However, at UCSD, I took courses purely for the sake of learning. Then, it hit me: all this time, I should have studied for the love of learning, not for the grades. With this mindset, I never lost an A grade. I felt terrible about myself! I wanted to at least have one degree where I could be satisfied - and that was my Ph.D. I did my Ph.D. in computer science because that was my background from my master&rsquo;s. Here, I realized that I loved theory. &rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">Rajiv&rsquo;s approach to learning focuses on an intrinsic desire to learn the subject matter over focusing on the end grade. It&rsquo;s something most of us have heard at one point or another, but he finally took the advice to heart. His Ph.D. was simply a way for him to act on a new motivation. Naturally, we next asked Rajiv, &ldquo;What other advice do you have for Penn students regarding how to make the most out of their college experience?&rdquo; He responded,</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;Stop making comparisons between yourself and others. There will always be people &nbsp;who are doing amazing things. You need to focus on what your strengths are, what you can learn from others, and, most importantly, doing your best&hellip; Keep in mind, some of the most successful people were not necessarily 4.0&rsquo;s. Some of the most successful people had very average transcripts. So I don&rsquo;t believe that academic performance is an accurate barometer for success.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">Following this advice may help to foster a more collaborative learning environment on Penn&rsquo;s campus. It boils down to two definitions of success: being the best possible or simply better than the rest. Intent on hearing Rajiv&rsquo;s definition of success, we asked him how he thought Penn students should define success. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 16pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;I think success is what one decides for one&rsquo;s self. &nbsp;For me, I consider my students&rsquo; success as my success. So my goals and my students&rsquo; goals are very aligned. Now, that is also wonderful for the students because they know they have someone who works in their interests. People&rsquo;s perspectives are different. I think success is defined differently for each person. It is very easy to get caught up when you are at Penn and you see people getting jobs at well-known companies. You may think, &ldquo;That is success&rdquo;, and then try to chase after someone else&rsquo;s achievements. However, I believe it is very important for each of us to define success individually for ourselves.</span> </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"color: #2b2b2b;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt; color: #2b2b2b;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Stop fearing failure. Stop comparing yourself to others. Take risks and succeed in your own way.&rdquo;</span></em></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\">Rajiv&rsquo;s emphasis on individually defining what success means is a valuable suggestion. Many students on Penn&rsquo;s campus speak of Penn&rsquo;s pre-professional culture, which may proliferate forms of unhealthy competition and generalizes what it means to be successful. By understanding what your goals and aspirations are, you will be able to better enjoy your college and post-college years sans the critical comparison.</span></p>",

What he found was disheartening. At the Texas base location, the only medical screening tool being used for mental health assessments on veterans was a dated 10 question survey. Molaro comments on how these surveys can be subjective by nature and prone to error. He also noted that there is a negative stigma tied to mental health disorders that causes people to avoid the matter or mark it as taboo. The harsh reality still stands: 22 veterans a day commit suicide and 8 million Americans are diagnosed with PTSD each year. Molaro recognized the lack of understanding on how the human brain reacts and what goes on in these veteran&rsquo;s minds, but he did not yet have a plan to start a company to solve this problem.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This all changed when he joined the Philadelphia chapter of the InSITE Fellowship&mdash;a competitive leadership development program that focused on innovative technology companies. It was there that Molaro met his co-founder, bioengineering PhD candidate Adam Pardes. With Molaro&rsquo;s experience with veterans&rsquo; mental health and Pardes&rsquo; knowledge of biotechnology, NeuroFlow began to take form.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The pair built out their idea and business model for NeuroFlow and soon entered the Wharton Business Plan Competition. Molaro chuckles, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even make it past the first round.&rdquo; Their technology was not yet developed, but this first failure motivated the duo to give their company a real shot.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Molaro and Pardes, both still graduate students, poured as much time as they could into NeuroFlow. Molaro stated, &ldquo;Every free minute is spent on NeuroFlow.&rdquo; &nbsp;They have early morning meetings from 7:30 to 9 am and would go to class right after. It was not uncommon to work long into the night. Molaro said that has main sacrifice in starting this company has been sleep. In the past month, Molaro estimates that they spend 70-80 hours per week on NeuroFlow. &nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Molaro and Pardes expanded their business plan and advanced their technology and software. Their hard work began to pay off. They won the Wharton Venture Award, the Wharton Innovation Fund, and were accepted into the PennApps Accelerator. They took what they learned from their first failure and kept pushing forward. They expanded their team with software engineers and bioengineers. Recently, the NeuroFlow team won the Philadelphia Shark Tank Award and are approved for a human clinical study in February at Penn Hospital. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 16pt; color: #2b2b2b;\">The Software:</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt; color: #2b2b2b;\">The NeuroFlow software does not diagnose disorders.

He first dabbled in the tech sector by taking a year off between middle and high school to work on his first start up. After it failed, his mentality was only reaffirmed. Returning back to school, he became an early adopter of the hackathon scene, read technical magazines such as Bloomberg West and TechCrunch, and began investing Bitcoin, stocks, and other commodities. He dove head first into both sides of FinTech; it&rsquo;s no wonder his start-up, Slice Capital, functions in this same intersection.</span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px; padding-left: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #333333; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;I was reading on Reddit that the laws were going to be changing in 2016 [to allow] non-accredited investors to invest in private companies. I wanted to be a user and invest in these private companies.&rdquo; But when he searched for a platform that facilitates this, he came up empty. There, he found the problem that his growing startup, Slice Capital, addresses. &ldquo;Our goal is to democratize venture capital,&rdquo; he says proudly, &ldquo;We make it possible for anyone to invest alongside the top investors.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">The first iteration of the business plan proposed an approach that closely mimicked the competitors. There were high fees, it only existed as a web app, and there was no strategy support for users. Over time, the team at Slice Capital grew and shaped the product to solve these issues and more. Shah accredits much of this influence to the different groups at Penn. &ldquo;Working on a fin-tech startup in such a finance heavy school is super helpful.&rdquo; And it shows. Slice has already been through PennApps accelerator, Weiss Labs, and currently, VIPx, three major incubators on campus, to receive as much advice as possible. In addition to insight, they have been funded by PennApps accelerator and WeissLabs and taken mentorship from them as well.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">Besides the well-established groups, Shah also draws attention to a severely underrated resource on campus: the professors. &ldquo;The professors here are brilliant,&rdquo; he says. If he were to turn back the clocks and start over, he would speak more to his professors starting in freshman year. Many have experience in the field of entrepreneurship, most have experience in research or the industry, yet this is the resource he claims most students &ldquo;take for granted&rdquo;. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">Over the years he has handpicked an arsenal of support for his startup from across campus to get his business rolling. A huge part of that support network happens to be his team. The defining moment in what has been a rollercoaster of a process was constructing a good core team. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t just crazy, there [were] other people who believed in Slice just as much as I do.&rdquo;</span> </span></p>",

But how many of us hold onto those aspirations and pursue them? Here on campus, Penn Aerospace aims to foster a spirit of innovation. The club encourages people &ldquo;to reach for these lofty ambitions they have.&rdquo; Penn Aerospace chases after this ambition within the four teams of the club: Operations, Rocket, Aircraft, and Balloon. Each team works on bringing speakers to Penn, organizing entrepreneurship events, or building aircraft to take to the skies. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Roboto Slab'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Victoria Peng gives new insight on a club that is typically dominated by engineers and mathematicians. Peng describes her psychology degree as &ldquo;straight up humanities,&rdquo; but challenges herself anyways in this new discipline. Though she grew up in Pasadena, California, famous for Caltech and Nasa&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, she never felt that science and math were accessible to her. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Roboto Slab'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Come Junior year Peng thought to herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a great time with humanities, but let me see if I can roll with these guys who are talking very technical terms.&rdquo; While the thought of applying to Penn Aerospace was daunting, she took on the application with her own unique perspective. One of the questions was &ldquo;What have you recently created?&rdquo; Peng racked her mind, and finally settled on a masterpiece of her own: blueberry lattice pie.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: 'Roboto Slab';\">One of Peng&rsquo;s favorite parts of being in Penn Aerospace is that the club brings in speakers that connects members to prominent industry leaders. Her favorite Penn Aerospace memory was when they &nbsp;&ldquo;had a speaker, a student speaker, this past semester for our GBM, Olivia Landgrover. She&rsquo;s got a great resume. She was talking about her work experience and what she&rsquo;s studying.&rdquo; Interacting with various industry leaders inspired the Penn Aerospace Pitch Competition where students must write an executive pitch of an innovative idea related to aerospace. The winner is picked by judges from NASA and Boeing, and receives $5,000. Penn Aerospace&rsquo;s goal is to continue to innovate and include others within the aerospace community after only being founded in 2014.</span> </span></p>",

You&rsquo;ve got to be revenue-driven and capture market share - it&rsquo;s how you play the game.&rdquo; But money isn&rsquo;t everything, customers are. Though he believes generating revenue is essential to business&rsquo; life-processes, Josh also believes that &ldquo;staying profit-driven should never come at the expense of morals - as soon as you start neglecting your customers, you&rsquo;ve lost the game.&rdquo; With pure hard work, Josh took his love for building websites to the next level.</span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px; padding-left: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #333333; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;My partner and I went door to door, knocking on people's businesses, asking to speak to owners, asking to speak to managers, every day, for months.

Josh initially realized that web-development had its scope; he wanted to expand into tech-product development - a pretty general term that encompasses technical and business initiatives including requirement definitions, technical development, building team chemistry, effective support, and fixing bugs. Upon realizing that many fledgling tech businesses were ambitiously taking on all of these challenges along with associated financial risk, Josh realigned his vision for Chop Dawg from a web-dev firm into business&rsquo; outsourced CTO - so that tech businesses with great ideas can reach out for technical consultation, development, and mentorship. Now, Chop Dawg invests in visionary startups (https://chopdawg.com/portfolio) experimenting with new technologies (VR, AR, wearables) and applications.

After some figuring, she switched from Mathematics into Computer Science and added a Gender Studies double major in sophomore year. It&rsquo;s not just what she studies, though. It&rsquo;s a niche intersection between tech and women and minorities in tech, but she&rsquo;s made a lifestyle out of it.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I like to call it community building,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It all boils down to that.&rdquo; Over her four years at Penn, she has contributed to Femme Hacks, the all-female hackathon at Penn, and started her own program called <a style=\"box-sizing: inherit; background-color: transparent; color: #039be5; text-decoration-line: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;\" href=\"https://techitoutphilly.com/\">Tech It Out</a>. It started out small, just gathering 50 students from Philly public schools for a day to introduce them to robotics, circuitry, web dev, and scratch programming. </span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px; padding-left: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #333333; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I really liked that but I think the biggest flaw that I saw was that it was too short. We would introduce these kids to these really awesome things and then they would go home and have no way to continue learning because a lot of schools don&rsquo;t offer CS and a lot of them don&rsquo;t have computers at home to work on this.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Now, Tech It Out continues the one-day crash course to reach the 50 students. Amelia then takes a portion of them to meet every Sunday, for eight Sundays a semester to teach them HTML, CSS, and basic web dev. In the end, they have a fully functioning website about a social issue that they care about. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;They love it.&rdquo; She says, proudly. And rightly so. Even within the three years, she has been running Tech It Out, she has seen a great deal of success. &ldquo;A lot of my students come to Femme Hacks, which is the All-Women hackathon that Penn does, It's really great to see them come and get more involved in the tech community. A few of them told me they&rsquo;ve started STEM clubs at their school.&rdquo; All of them have indicated an interest in the field of computer science. In a way, Amelia is the person she wishes she had a long time ago. Her goal was to introduce minority students to CS early and say, &ldquo;You can do this,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s exactly what she is doing.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I tell this to everyone I see,&rdquo; she says, sitting up in her seat. &ldquo;One of our students got into Penn and is going to be a coach for Tech It Out when he comes.&rdquo; His acceptance and involvement itself is a triumph to her. He had odds stacked against him from the start, coming from one of the less well-funded public schools in the area. &ldquo;He told me and I cried a little.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The most stunning example, however, was also one of the most heartbreaking. In the past, groups have come up with websites about heavy topics such as homophobia, drug abuse, racism, and gender inequality. Amelia distinctly remembers one her students who made a website about homelessness. The student making the site later told Amelia she was homeless for a while and normally avoids the memory. Nevertheless, she told her story on the website and asked other students about their experience. Three other students came up to support her. As she finished her website later, she made it a point to come to Amelia and tell her, &ldquo;this is really empowering&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;That was sad but also really wonderful,&rdquo; Amelia said. All the tech focus fell apart then and her soft spot for social issues shined through.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Stories like her&rsquo;s serve as part of Amelia&rsquo;s inspiration.

Together, the husband and wife taught him 5 years of mathematics from 7th through 11th grade, responsible for everything from pre-algebra to statistics. &ldquo;I had this sort of mathematical bent,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and I knew I liked computers. I originally planned on doing computer engineering or chemical engineering because I had a great chemistry teacher in high school.&rdquo; Watching his roommate solve interesting computer science problems brewed his interest. Dr. Zdancewic then took a discrete math course in the following semester, which all but sealed the deal. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Throughout his time as an undergraduate, he dipped his hands in the three areas that CS undergrads are drawn to - corporate internships, startups, and research experiences. He spent one summer programming at Merck, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in New Jersey, another at a start-up programming databases for web servers, and a third conducting research. After working in all three spheres, Dr. Zdancewic found research to be the most rewarding and thus went on to complete a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Cornell University.

Then, during my 'gap year' between high school and college, someone asked me to design a website. I asked, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s a website?&rsquo; They told me about the Internet and gave me a book on HTML. This changed everything. Almost immediately, I became obsessed with computers.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 16pt; color: #000000;\">Despite this revelation, Dr. Wallach started college as an engineering student. However, at the end of her first year, she switched to computer science. When Dr. Wallach entered the computer science program, she was behind. She had been specializing in engineering, so she did not have the same level of computer science knowledge as the other students. She was undeterred. Dr. Wallach was not afraid to make the switch because she knew computer science was the right path for her.

Social processes are incredibly complex, filled with biases, irrational and rational decision making, emotions, and a wide range of other human factors. Dr. Wallach and other pioneers in computational social science use digitized data and computational methods to study social processes through mathematical and analytical eyes. Dr. Wallach's research focuses on uncovering patterns in observed data, such as news articles, meeting transcripts, public records requests, and emails. &ldquo;For example, a political scientist might want to use congressional votes and bill text to understand when and why senators' voting patterns deviate from what would be expected from their party affiliations.&rdquo; From this example alone, it&rsquo;s easy to see that the applications of machine learning in the social sciences are vast.

Fortunately, Dr. Wallach plays an active role in promoting and supporting women in computing. She co-founded the WiML (Women in Machine Learning) Workshop, which has grown from around 100 attendees in 2006 to over 600 attendees in 2016.

There is an endless amount of defeat and refactoring, planning and failed execution that discourages students from ever following their entrepreneurial goals. What students tend to assume is that they have to do it alone. Instead, David Ongchoco created <a style=\"box-sizing: inherit; background-color: transparent; color: #039be5; text-decoration-line: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;\" href=\"https://youthhack.net/\">YouthHack</a>, an organization that allows young, aspiring entrepreneurs to foster their ideas in a collaborative environment.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">David Ongchoco is currently a junior studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. He founded YouthHack during the summer before college with the intent of creating an organization that encourages high school and college students to collaborate and pursue their entrepreneurial interests. Within three years, YouthHack has expanded its reach globally by hosting chapters in Singapore and South Korea. We asked David about what led him to start YouthHack before even coming to college: </span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px; padding-left: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #333333; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;During the summer before my freshman year at Penn, I was able to attend a talk by Salman Khan, the founder of Khan Academy. During the talk, Salman discussed the different ways we can use technology to solve problems. It was very inspiring to me, especially during the period of transition between high school and college. From his talk, I realized that with the right people, technology, and environment, anything is possible. Before I started college, I really wanted to create an environment for high school students in the Philippines to use their creative ideas to help solve problems. With the four months I had left, I tried and tested different avenues for creating this sort of entrepreneurial environment. YouthHack was one of these avenues.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Originally, YouthHack was intended to be a two-day event in the Philippines, where high school students could experience the prototyping process, learn to work with others, and even pitch to investors. By the end of the event, several students ended up working on their own startup or interning at existing ones. One group of high school seniors worked on developing a centralized college application, similar to the CommonApp, in order to address the growing need for an online college application in the Philippines. During David&rsquo;s freshman year at Penn, this group of students flew to Penn and Harvard to pitch their ideas to professors and at startup competitions. Wharton professor Ian Mcmillan was so impressed with the drive of the high school students that he encouraged David to start a YouthHack chapter in Philadelphia. </span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px; padding-left: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #333333; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;This was when YouthHack turned from being a one time event to an organization.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Around 30 students attended the first YouthHack event in Philadelphia. Eager to spread the word, David started writing <a style=\"box-sizing: inherit; background-color: transparent; color: #039be5; text-decoration-line: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/david-ongchoco\">frequent blog posts</a> about his vision for YouthHack along with its progress. Eventually, a high school student in Singapore came across one David&rsquo;s posts and asked about starting a YouthHack chapter in Singapore. &ldquo;It was super exciting. I got a cold email from someone I had never even met asking to bring YouthHack to Singapore. I was like &lsquo;hell yeah&rsquo;, and started preparing for expansion.&rdquo; During his freshman summer at Penn, David flew to Singapore to work with this student to work on expanding YouthHack. The first event in Singapore was wildly successful - over 100 high school and college students met to pitch their ideas to venture capitalists, listen to the advice of successful Singaporean entrepreneurs, and even learn to code. That same summer, David also ran an event in Hong Kong, which met paralleled success.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Inspired by David&rsquo;s determination, we wanted to know what obstacles David faced during the conception of YouthHack, along with how he overcame these obstacles. </span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px; padding-left: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #333333; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">&ldquo;I definitely encountered a lot of initial obstacles. During our first few events, we had under 10 people registered, which was very upsetting considering how much preparation we had put in. One day, I came across a picture on Facebook with around 30 high school kids who had attended a well known academic summer camp. Through Facebook Messenger, I reached out to these kids asking them to register to YouthHack, and share the info on their respective high school&rsquo;s Facebook page.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">His strategy worked. Attendance at YouthHack meetings shot up from 10 to over 120 people. &ldquo;It was at this time when I realized that if you want something bad enough and put enough effort into making something happen, the world has a really nice way of helping you. This realization was the driving force for the rest of the YouthHack expansion.&rdquo; When asked about his vision for the future of the organization, David responded, </span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px; padding-left: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #333333; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I think as of now, I really want YouthHack to remain student run and be sustainable by the time I graduate. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s really about inspiring students to overcome their fears in order to pursue their own entrepreneurial interests. When considering whether they should chase after an idea, I want students to ask themselves, &lsquo;why not?&rsquo; Honestly, my perception of YouthHack&rsquo;s future may change from day to day, but it's really just about inspiring students.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Keep in mind that when David is not managing the Hong Kong, Singapore, Philadelphia, and soon to be South Korea chapters of YouthHack, he is a full-time student at Penn pursuing two majors. Surprised by his commitments, we asked David how he balances YouthHack, academics, friends, and sleep. </span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 20px 0px; padding-left: 1.5rem; border-left: 5px solid #333333; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;You know the feeling when you have to do something or nothing will happen? I think in the earlier days, especially around 2014 and 2015, I really had to push to make things happen. When you&rsquo;re the one who starts something, it&rsquo;s always on your mind. Whenever I have something to do for YouthHack, everything else comes second. It&rsquo;s hard to maintain a balance between everything, but you just have to continue making progress. One of my biggest goals now is to learn how to sustainably scale an organization.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 16pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Through David&rsquo;s determination, YouthHack has developed into a team of students passionate about providing support and encouragement to potential entrepreneurs. It&rsquo;s safe to say that David didn&rsquo;t let inexperience or failure prevent him from making his idea a reality.</span></p>",

After examining his most current project, <a href=\"https://bingdom.co/\">Bingdom Studios</a>, we&rsquo;ll see how his years in college, YouTube, and startup <a href=\"victorious.com\">Victorious</a> shaped his ability to drive Bingdom.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Bingdom Studios operates as three separate entities. Firstly, it is a venture capital firm funding exciting opportunities in new media. Secondly, it advises roughly 18 digital media companies from startups to billion dollar enterprises. Finally, Bingdom creates and invests in its own creative universes, much like Marvel or Star Wars, but with a very interesting and compelling twist.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Bingdom will creatively and culturally help us re-imagine each of the four pivotal human experiences while providing a set of practical services that eases each. The four critical human life experiences are birth, marriage (human relationships), profession, and death. Each of our universes will tackle one of these four arenas, beginning with death. Together, they&rsquo;ll hopefully help answer humanity&rsquo;s oldest question: why am I here?&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Bing further explained why death is important and why Bingdom strives to address it.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Philosophically, &ldquo;Death is the definitive deadline for self-actualizing--or becoming who you&rsquo;re meant to be. As far as we know, all we have is what we know and all we know--as humans--is now.&rdquo; Bing wants to help people answer the question: &ldquo;If death is your deadline, how do you make sure that you live the life you want to faster and more deeply?&rdquo; Bing then explained his practical reasoning:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;There are 75 million baby boomers who are at the end of their lives in the United States right now. It is the largest influx of natural deaths in nearly 5 centuries. The challenge with the West is we&rsquo;re really provincial in how we think about and treat death. We fear it. Not only do we shun conversations about it, but portions of the death industry have been able to exploit that immutability. The average funeral in the United States, for instance, costs roughly $7,000-$10,000 dollars, which is cost-prohibitive for most people. It&rsquo;s literally too expensive to die--and even more expensive to pronounce your legacy. That&rsquo;s not acceptable.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;This, coupled with existential millennial trends--namely heightened economic depletion (millennials have delayed canonical rites of passage like buying property, getting married, and having children); a rise in clinical depression and suicide; and aversion/disavowment of traditional institutional associations (religion, government, etc.)--renders self-actualization a evermore critical cross-generational issue.&rdquo; He explains with his own experiences:</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-29b3b6e0-62f4-ac47-9fb7-2148bd21f8b1\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a host of indelible experiences that have, in different ways, forced me to reconcile identity, which might be why I care about it [self-actualization] so much.

That&rsquo;s not how it works. You help them find a reason to breathe again.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In success, Bingdom looks like the modern-day Walt Disney company. The company has been extremely quiet developing its first creative franchise that launches across multiple platforms in 2017 with over 100 celebrities and leading companies. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">During his college years, Bing saw that Rich Ross, former Chairman of Walt Disney Studios and now CEO of Discovery, along with Stacey Snider, former CEO of Dreamworks and now CEO of 20th Century Fox, two of many highly successful media titans that studied English at Penn. Spotting this pattern, he envisioned his success in media through Penn&rsquo;s English program.

He was also a member of the Sphinx and Oracle Senior Honor Societies. Bing&rsquo;s track-record of &ldquo;going for it&rdquo; also expanded to acting on the side and heavy extracurriculars. &ldquo;I went for auditions or petty work and have some horror stories from it.

My dream was to be like Walt Disney and Oprah,&rdquo; he explained. He especially seemed to resonate with Oprah - &ldquo;She had a literal stage where she would allow people to self-actualize. And, remember: this was a Black woman in the 90s on TV. The fact that she looked different and, yet, was still able to create this universally-applicable and resonant platform was really compelling.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Bing took his vision through college and into YouTube, where he architected most of the now-multi-billion dollar global influencer ecosystem&rsquo;s programs, through which he scaled the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiijKiZqpbWAhUmxVQKHYRyCgEQFggoMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fyoutube%2Fanswer%2F72851%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6qyFyxlk2M5v8emCf2DWbfB10mw\">Partner Program</a> globally, co-founded the company&rsquo;s marquee talent incubator, and led several community investments in events like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY44maqpbWAhXLqVQKHZN1CMMQFggqMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvidcon.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNESxizCE47X-r4y1WObE1cbnCjxxQ\">VidCon</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNiNCnqpbWAhWljVQKHYKsAxEQFggoMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedigitour.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgkxcUFEL3bZ-pnb2m6gdEE6o23A\">DigiTour</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwios8esqpbWAhXLjlQKHdzeAXcQFggoMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2FYtfanfest&amp;usg=AFQjCNEaorI-c4aBa-1PxqtKGVWM67Wm4g\">YouTube FanFest</a>. To give a perspective of the scale of what this 25 year-old was doing: the Partner Program drives billions in revenue each year; the talent incubator has since been launched over 35 times on 6 continents for hundreds of creators; and VidCon is now the largest online video convention in the world. Using Walt Disney as his model, he also implemented a global rewards system, including the widely-recognized YouTube <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0ahUKEwissPC7qpbWAhXrhFQKHY6cCGMQFghUMAo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fyt%2Fcreators%2Frewards.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbVPFQpcY_0PDAU-9ysXmkeEKoQg\">Gold Play Button</a>. He was the most decorated person under the age of 30 at YouTube and made the Forbes list during his time. Bing attributes his successes to his incredible bosses, mentors and collaborating with much more senior and experienced executives. Despite his trail of success, Bing described, &ldquo;It became a bit soul-sucking - not because I was working 90-100 hours per week because everyone works a lot but because I was building someone else&rsquo;s dream. I was building creators&rsquo; dreams as well as a platform for someone else. It wasn&rsquo;t 100% the vision I wanted because compromises had to be made. At some point, I wasn&rsquo;t willing to make any more compromises. I learned everything I could and it was time to move on.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Moving on, Bing then co-founded his own company, Victorious, which envisioned to empower users to be themselves online by engaging with content that speaks to them. Victorious helped creators create and monetize content; it intelligently connected the backends of several apps and websites to cross promote data, content, and user experiences so users could access the content that they love. Bing&rsquo;s close friendships with stars like Boyce Avenue, Ryan Higa, and Jenna Marbles delivered amazing early business development success. In fact, Victorious signed &ldquo;more partners in six months than the largest new media company in the world had in seven years, at the time.&rdquo; His reputation in the space, alongside his co-founders, also raised the company more than $50 million from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD957GqpbWAhXBh1QKHV2ABBwQFggoMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kpcb.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGG4GoIM2ariqCS3sx0VAaKudPjzQ\">Kleiner Perkins</a> and many other top venture capital firms. Despite the early success, Bing realized that he had once again backburned his boyhood creative dreams to build someone else&rsquo;s; so, he left after 2 years. &ldquo;I confused what I was good at for what I really wanted.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\">Bing then founded Bingdom and has since met many successes, particularly in his Board Director and Advisory Board work--and soon in his first creative franchise next year.

She is the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Lab Director at Penn Fertility Care. Berger is in charge of the embryology lab, endocrinology lab, and andrology lab. IVF is a fairly recent, quickly evolving field, and Berger is spearheading the movement.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-2223e7a5-b0c8-b3db-58fc-e06a8fb20eaa\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Dara Berger got her BA in biology later continuing on to get her PhD in Human Genetics. During her PhD, she took interest in the problem of infertility. She then &ldquo;found a mentor, and kind of latched on, and went from there.&rdquo; Berger&rsquo;s first introduction to reproductive health was when she was shadowing a genetic counselor at an IVF clinic. At that time, she wasn&rsquo;t sure what type of genetics she wanted to concentrate in, but when she saw pictures of embryos decorating her genetics counselor&rsquo;s office, she thought it was &ldquo;the coolest thing ever.&rdquo; Berger also took a stem cell research class in 2001 that focused on the ethics of embryos and found it fascinating. At that time she did not even know that embryology was something she could do. Her fate was truly cemented when she was conducting her student research and started looking at recurrent pregnancy loss. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Getting into the field of IVF isn&rsquo;t the easiest path to take. Currently there are no specific programs, classes, or majors for andrologists and embryologists. There&rsquo;s no in-school training, albeit there might be one or two programs that Berger knows of. She says the experience is akin to an &ldquo;an apprenticeship&hellip; Somebody has to train you, and the only way to train is hands-on.&rdquo; Most IVF programs are private practices. Most lab directors, embryologists and andrologists welcome the opportunity to talk about their jobs and/or allow students to shadow. Berger stresses that there is a high demand for embryologists and andrologists, and yet not that many people who go into the field. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;One of the things I like so much about what I do is that it is new.&rdquo; The first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born in the late 1970s -- &ldquo;Many of the people who invented IVF are still alive.&rdquo; There is constantly new research and development going on in the world of IVF. Berger&rsquo;s current research has revolved around using time lapse in incubators. In general practice, while the embryo is in the incubator, embryologists take the embryo out everyday to check on the progress of it. Now, embryologists are introducing time lapse which uses cameras inside the incubators to monitor the health of the embryos. Leaving the embryos and their environment undisturbed will improve the quality of the embryo. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">One of the problems in IVF that researchers are trying solve is that it is hard to gather data about egg quality and maturity. Typically, the number of polar bodies in an egg can be used to determine if the egg is mature. Berger states that, &ldquo;When you have one polar body, it&rsquo;s mature and ready to be inseminated by sperm or fertilized by sperm.&rdquo; However, sometimes even though the egg looks mature, it does not fertilize. Berger says, &ldquo;a lot of that is due to egg quality and cytoplasmic maturity. But there&rsquo;s no way to measure cytoplasmic maturity right now. You can look at it, but they all look the same.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When looking towards her personal future, Berger would like to see herself teaching undergraduates in about ten years, since she believes universities need more academia and student exposure revolving around IVF and reproductive health. She also emphasized her love of ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection of eggs), which is the process of injecting sperm into the egg to make an embryo. Berger states, &ldquo;I could ICSI all day.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;One of the things that I do really like is we have meetings every Friday, where we talk about patients&rsquo; cycles that are going through IVF and we review their situation. We do this with a big group &ndash; lab staff, nursing, attendings, and fellows&mdash;it&rsquo;s everyone in one room talking about the patients, and I really enjoy that. You get everyone&rsquo;s opinion and everyone is together.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>",

Your blood is sampled, and your doctor tells you that you may have to wait anywhere from 24 hours to a full week for the arrival of your blood test results. Because the treatment of your condition depends on the diagnosis, there is not much to do but wait. Instead of leaving the doctor with a treatment plan, you leave with a reminder to check back in once your lab results are ready. A recent Penn graduate, Brianna Wronko, provides a viable solution to this problem.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Brianna is the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.groupkdiagnostics.com/\">Group K Diagnostics</a>, a startup that produces a cheap, easy to use chip called the MultiDiagnostic, which accurately diagnoses different liver diseases. &ldquo;You just prick your finger, touch the MultiDiagnostic, wait at most 20 minutes, upload a picture of the chip to our corresponding iPhone app, and receive your diagnosis.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This point of care solution allows for self-diagnosis for a total of $12.

In some cases, the patient won&rsquo;t even come back to check their test results.&rdquo; She designed the chip using microfluidics, a technology that allows for the precise manipulation and control of fluids on a very small scale. &ldquo;An analyte in your blood reacts with specifically printed substances and solutions on the MultiDiagnostic and produces a color change.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Although the idea was great, it&rsquo;s scope and development was constrained to the classroom. Brianna decided that she would consider pursuing the idea as a post graduation opportunity if she won the <a href=\"https://www.curf.upenn.edu/presidents-innovation-prize\">President&rsquo;s Innovation Prize</a>. The prize wasn&rsquo;t awarded to Brianna, but her aspirations were still realized when she made it to the final round of <a href=\"https://www.dreamit.com/\">DreamIt Ventures</a>, a prominent startup accelerator which focuses on health related innovation.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I applied after some prodding from others.

After graduating from Penn this May, she began working for her startup full time. This next stage in her life was accompanied by a major schedule change. &ldquo;I wake up around 7-8 in the morning, work till around 5-6 in the evening, come back and settle down, eat dinner, tidy up the apartment a little bit, and then work again for 3-4 hours.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Brianna&rsquo;s dedication to her product is demonstrated by her incredible work ethic. However, with such a hectic schedule, there didn&rsquo;t seem like there was much time to relax. Eventually, Brianna realized that working constantly just wasn&rsquo;t sustainable.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I used to think that I could work 24 hours a day. It just becomes very hard, especially when you are leading the development of a product. I remember one time when I was really sick, we needed to find lab space to continue the development of our product. I just had to keep working, because when you're running a startup, you can&rsquo;t just stop working when you&rsquo;re sick. Now, I realize that I can&rsquo;t take care of my company if I&rsquo;m not taking care of myself. I try to find time each day to just do something non-work related, whether it's just talking to someone, reading a book, or just relaxing.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In addition to the general challenges that are associated with leading a company, Brianna also experienced the difficulties of being a woman in tech and entrepreneurship. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more difficult to be taken seriously. Especially as a 21 year old female.&rdquo; Brianna mentioned that there are also smaller microaggressions that people don&rsquo;t really notice. She pointed out that the men&rsquo;s bathroom is generally closer to the lab and better kept than the women&rsquo;s bathroom due to the lack of females doing lab work. Many often romanticize the startup life, but Brianna made sure to emphasize the reality of the situation.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;You know, I remember one time I saw a graph which described what it was like to lead a startup over time. Initially, the happiness, and progress were steadily increasing. Then both of them dropped and started drastically fluctuating. I thought, &lsquo;That won&rsquo;t happen to me! Everything will be sort of constant!&rsquo; Well I was wrong. There may be many highs while running a startup but there are also many lows.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Brianna attributed being homeschooled as a factor that has enabled her to successfully overcome the challenges she&rsquo;s faced as the leader of Group K Diagnostics. She believes that the autonomy and freedom she was exposed to when she was homeschooled greatly prepared for her roles as a college student and the leader of a startup. Furthermore, Brianna emphasized the difference between what Penn teaches you and what non-school related work teaches you. &ldquo;Penn taught me how to think, but I learned most of the skills relevant to the work I&rsquo;m doing now from industry and research experiences.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As busy as she is, Brianna stressed that, &ldquo;Penn students should enjoy and appreciate their time here. I really miss Penn.&rdquo; Regarding want-to-be entrepreneurs and innovators, Brianna offered the following advice:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let someone tell you that you can&rsquo;t do something. I had people and professors tell me that I shouldn't pursue my idea outside of the classroom because it was not going to be successful. Now it is. I think you just have to keep pushing forward.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

His partnerships grew out of internships he held as an undergrad. Their company was called &ldquo;rentmine.com&rdquo; -- an online rental market for all things, from lawnmowers to textbooks.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The downfall of this company was the fact that none of the three founders had any technical experience that would allow them to understand the development of their product better. They ended up having to outsource their web development, leaving them unsatisfied. They ultimately decided to work with a local development firm, but the progress was slow-moving. After 18 months, no minimum value product was developed and Finn was feeling taken advantage of because of his limited computer programming experience. The company went under.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finn decided he would never let that happen to him again.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">He never again wanted to be in a position where he could not understand the principles behind the technology of his own company. He enrolled in the computer science master&rsquo;s degree at Penn designed for people who have not written a line of code in their life. His ultimate goal was to gain the skills he needed to manage a coding project moving forward.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finn ended up loving the computer science and engineering experience much more than he initially expected to. He feels that in hindsight, he should have probably studied computer science as an undergrad, but was never really exposed to code or deep technology before his 20&rsquo;s. This period of his life was the first time he was deeply invested in his courses and worked harder at them than he ever had before.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After completing his master&rsquo;s, Finn worked as a full stack software engineer at <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/\">Bloomberg</a> for 4 years, but always knew he wanted to get back into the startup world. He packed his bags and moved back to Philly from New York to begin his next chapter as a Wharton MBA student. Finn applied to the MBA program to expose himself to more people in the business world and grow his knowledge of the Philly startup scene. He was also looking for a co-founder amongst his classmates.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://localstove.com/\">LocalStove</a> was started the fall of Finn&rsquo;s second year at Wharton. The idea came from the free lunches provided at the numerous Wharton MBA club events. Finn describes the food spectrum of these lunches as, &ldquo;Papa John&rsquo;s to Jimmy John&rsquo;s -- not unique or delicious&rdquo;. Many of his international classmates would bring in their own fantastic dishes from all over the world, often cooked by spouses or family who had ventured to America with them as they completed their MBA. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finn, a big fan of good food, set up a &ldquo;scrappy&rdquo; e-commerce site and sold international food out of a study room in Huntsman Hall. He worked alongside students and their families to cook the dishes. People pre-ordered what they wanted and picked it up in Huntsman the next day. Thus, LocalStove was born.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After just 5 days, LocalStove was already turning a profit. Finn figured he could get serious about this new venture.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">He and his co-founder recruited cooks around Philly to make and sell dishes. They also built a real web platform for their business, something Finn, with his broadened programming skills, could now execute himself. They created a marketplace for local cooks to list their food for users to choose. They launched their original model two weeks before graduation.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">LocalStove&rsquo;s main business venture currently is catering, which they almost fell into by accident. It started as a marketing ploy to get their name out to multiple people at once. Before they knew it, more and more people, companies, and organizations were requesting catering menus. Catering was not only popular, but also cost effective. It sliced their delivery expenses and increased their amount of pre-orders. Following this streak of success, LocalStove is innovating and offering subscription-based lunches.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finn leaves us with advice for future entrepreneurs. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t build something just because it&rsquo;s a good idea; be prepared to live it, eat it, sleep it, breathe it.

Feeling too guilty to ask the company to pay for a hotel, he stayed at an old friend&rsquo;s apartment for the night instead. Abhi Ramesh listened while Darwish went on about building a coding school for millennials looking for a new direction. That conversation lead to what is now the <a href=\"https://www.joinhorizons.com/\">Horizons School of Technology</a>, their highly successful foray into private higher education. &nbsp;</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-43732165-5f66-ba49-7b5d-e98287ae0405\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Horizons was just the opportunity they were hoping for after their last play in the startup field. While both were college students, Darwish at Northwestern and Abhi at Penn, they started Altair Prep, a SAT test prep company. They generated a bank of answers to hundreds of SAT questions, tagged them into detailed subcategories, and put all the data into an Excel sheet. Then, they&rsquo;d take a student&rsquo;s test data and give back questions that they needed to see the most. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The model proved extremely successful. Soon, their spreadsheets started crashing with the traffic and they realized they needed a technical solution to the problem, so the partners went to find a CTO. They hired a friend of a friend, &ldquo;a Panamanian hacker. He didn&rsquo;t talk. He just coded. A lot.&rdquo; At this point, Darwish and Abhi weren&rsquo;t sure what they needed in an engineer, so they brought him on the team. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The company continued to grow to a six figure revenue business within a matter of months. The accelerating growth prompted the duo to apply to incubators for more guidance and resources while pushing Altair Prep along. At interviews, Abhi and Darwish would talk at length about the business and performance metrics but, being two non-technical founders, could not speak to the underlying structures that generated questions for the students. Interviewers caught on and asked the newly hired CTO about the technology behind the business to which he simply responded, &ldquo;Hey man, I just do the computers&rdquo;. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">That&rsquo;s when Darwish and Abhi were forced to reevaluate. They enjoyed the space, the work they did, and their tremendous rate of growth. But they lacked the experience they needed to properly hire, work with, and run a functioning team. &ldquo;We just weren&rsquo;t ready for it yet.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Darwish went back to school with the objective of finishing quickly. As soon as he graduated, he rejected his full time offers with the intention of moving to San Francisco to learn to code. After the technical hiring fiasco at Altair, he was convinced that being a non-technical founder was to his disadvantage. His mom stopped him. She handed him a new credit card, stating: &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going to turn down job offers that&rsquo;s fine with me but you&rsquo;re going to have to deal with the consequences.&rdquo; Darwish nodded and took the card. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I booked a one way flight to SF,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to pay for the two-way one.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After three months of coding, Darwish was staring down a couple job offers, one of which, <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/\">Optimizely</a>, stuck out. It was a small company offering a lower salary and lower position than the others on his table. Yet, he was still having trouble deciding. He sought advice from a speaker who he met while still in school at Northwestern. After listening to Darwish lay out the situation, he gave one piece of advice, a famous quote from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg\">Sheryl Sandberg</a>:</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 16pt;\"><em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don&rsquo;t ask what seat. You just get on.&rdquo;</span></em></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">So he joined Optimizely. And it was a rocket.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At the time he joined, there were about 80 people working on for the company. Over the course of three years, Darwish experienced a startling growth rate as the company burgeoned from 80 to 400 employees by the time he left. As the company evolved, so did his role. He shifted from technical to non-technical, up the ladder to down, and across different departments. He worked alongside the founders and saw their solutions to the logistical challenges of running a high growth startup. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;When working somewhere there&rsquo;s two things you have to think about. Rate of growth and rate of personal growth. When the company growth is faster than your personal growth you get situations like I had at Optimizely.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As soon as he gathered the experience he needed, he was ready to move on to his next adventure. And that&rsquo;s when he found himself in New York, in Abhi&rsquo;s apartment, discussing the plan for Horizons. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">* * *</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">That conversation happened in December 2015. Two weeks later, Darwish built the landing page of the website on a plane to visit family. The site went live on his flight back. February 2016 they added a CFO, Edward Lando, to the team. In March, Abhi quit his job. One week later, Darwish quit. The day he quit, he flew to New York, worked with Abhi in his apartment for the next month, then launched the first session of Horizons that summer with 30 students in Philadelphia.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The code school saw tremendous growth within the year. The first session in the summer of 2016 was held at Penn with mainly Penn students. The team migrated to San Francisco the following year in the spring of 2017 to lead a cohort there. By this past summer, they had 134 students from all over the country enrolled in the program. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\">If Horizons turns out to be Darwish&rsquo;s next rocket, which it is already proving to be, this is one flight he will be glad he didn&rsquo;t miss.</span> </span></p>",

Salomon Serfati, a curious kid with a knack for building things, had been waiting for college to start since he was accepted in late November the year before. Yet, with less than a week before the gap year deadline, he decided to go for it.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-2a82cdfa-6300-bf9e-b88c-816dfd16f62d\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">During part his gap year, Salo attended a program in Israel. The program taught him a great deal about the origins and philosophies of Hebrew, but it also exposed him to many new people and an experience of living halfway across the world. It was in Israel that Salo deeply connected with many other people who were also interested in entrepreneurship. He started to build a network and gain ideas from his peers. He knew he wanted to take the plunge and start a business. As he stated himself, &ldquo;I could never see myself working in the corporate world.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Over the summer, Salo, as an incoming college freshman, recognized how difficult it was to select a first year college roommate. There are university-affiliated survey programs and private companies who attempt to match students based on surface-level similar interests. Also, many students turn to randomly messaging people on Facebook in attempt to find someone they would want to live with. Salo thought, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if you could find your roommate through an app platform?&rdquo;. And with that, Bunks&trade; was born.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Bunks&trade; is a mobile platform that connects undergraduate with other graduate students at their respective schools who are looking for a roommates. Users can swipe through profiles and descriptions of potential roommates, and if they see someone they think would be a good fit, they can directly message them through the app to strike up a conversation.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Salo and his business partner spent the remainder of his gap year putting in work to make the app go live. They contacted overseas developers and worked with them to design the backend and user interface of the app. They also stamped out the legal plan and business model for their company. So far, Salo and his partner have launched the minimum viable product for Bunks&trade; and proved there is a need for their company through research and randomized app users. The missing piece in the puzzle was proving to investors that the app was profitable.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;There are three ways that apps become profitable,&rdquo; Salo says, &ldquo;marketing/advertising, offering a premium version (paid version), and in-app purchases.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For Bunks&trade; to become profitable, Salo and his partner are exploring avenues such as making a &ldquo;Bunks Marketplace&rdquo; within the app and partnering with specific universities to have them pay for their roommate matching service. They are also looking at the possibility of expanding their market past </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">college</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> roommates, instead targeting the roommate search sphere overall. Their current market includes the 3 million incoming freshman each year. Expanding their market even more grants them an increased amount of profitable opportunities.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Eventually, Salo and his team were able to present Bunks&trade; at demo day through YouthHack, a student-run entrepreneurship accelerator at Penn. At this demo day, Salo had the opportunity to pitch to big-time Philly investors. Salo thought, &ldquo;Being able to talk to these big time investors, hearing their feedback, and being able to answer back gives you confidence. You see these people on Shark Tank when you&rsquo;re a little kid, and then you realize, Hey, I&rsquo;m like them.&rdquo;</span></p>",

Your brain consists of a dense network of approximately 86 billion neurons, all packed in clusters of different shape, size, and form. Your Facebook profile is a small drop in an ocean of over 2 billion interacting users.

How does a network evolve over time given its structural properties? How do you control the flow of information through a network? Victor Preciado has discovered the answer to some of these questions and is searching for the rest.</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-9989577c-b097-f5b8-691e-605431804c21\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Victor is both a researcher and a Raj and Neera Singh assistant professor of electrical and systems engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. His research is focused on network analysis, optimization, and control. More specifically, Victor aims &ldquo;to use mathematical and computational techniques that lie at the core of network science to capture the essence of complex, high-dimensional dynamical systems.&rdquo; The applications of his research span from optimizing brain networks to better understanding sociological network evolution. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Victor&rsquo;s quest to contribute to these important research areas began in Seville, Spain, where he taught himself how to program on his first computer at an early age. However, his goals back then were a little different from his current research expertise. &ldquo;My childhood dream was to build computer games. That&rsquo;s how I got really interested in engineering and computing&rdquo;, Victor explained. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This initial interest in engineering and computing carried him through an electrical engineering degree during college and then to the U.S. to pursue higher education regarding engineering and mathematics. As part of his masters, Victor worked in the nonlinear electronics lab at the University of California, Berkeley. Victor&rsquo;s work at Berkeley focused on &ldquo;building electronic circuits for chaotic oscillators.&rdquo; However, his research on complex networks began at the </span><a href=\"https://www.santafe.edu\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sante Fe Institute</span></a><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">. A fellowship from Sante Fe catapulted Victor to a Ph.D. at MIT, where he started his journey to understand how the structural characteristics of a network effected a network&rsquo;s dynamical behavior.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;In particular, I used tools from algebraic graph theory and random metric theory to relate random models of very large networks with dynamical properties such as the speed of information spread in a social network, synchronization in a biological network, and other dynamical processes that can take place in networks.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Victor passionately explained that networks are composed of two layers. The first layer consists of the graph infrastructure itself. The second layer consists of the processes that take place on the first layer. Victor&rsquo;s current research tries to answer the following question: how do you infer properties about the second layer of the network given information about the first layer? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;ve always been interested in,&rdquo; Victor added.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Victor also focuses on network control.

This skill is well utilized in four courses Victor teaches at Penn: NETS 312, ESE 305, and two graduate level courses. In these courses, he focuses on teaching students how to analyze networks and take advantage of large amounts of data to answer their own questions. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Students attest to Victor&rsquo;s talent for teaching.

You may not know it yet, but you are very talented to something specific. The challenge is to find out what that is. You need to explore until you find that one thing you&rsquo;re passionate about.

It would use the surrounding words of the sentence to define a pattern and classify it as a food. Say you have the sentence &ldquo;John eats a shortbread cookie&rdquo;. The verb &ldquo;eat&rdquo; would help classify &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; as a food, the adjective &ldquo;shortbread&rdquo; would indicate what type of cookie is. NELL would learn these patterns and categorize words accordingly.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;The cool thing about NELL is that it keeps using the information that it has read to help you extract more information.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Back to the cookie example, what happens when NELL reads that someone throws away their Internet cookies? NELL combines what it already knows about Internet and about cookie and the relationship between &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; and &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; in a sentence to understand that an Internet cookie is a file, not a food. Just like that, the machine slowly learns how to interpret the intricacies of a language that has been built on by humans for centuries.

Then you give it a test and you run the same model that you already trained and you get an output and that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; NELL, however, is continually learning over time. It feeds the classifications it has already made back to the model so it never stops learning.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;In a way, it&rsquo;s becoming more like humans in terms of learning.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While she first made NELL to read English texts, Derry is onto even bigger things now: enabling machines to read texts in any language. Derry is one of Professor Chris Callison-Burch&rsquo;s post-doc researchers working in a subset of the field of Natural Language Processing. According to Chris Callison Burch (CCB), Derry is working on what he calls the Paraphrase Database. In English and many other languages, there are phrases that have the same meaning as individual words. For example, &ldquo;thrown in jail&rdquo; has the same meaning as &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; or &ldquo;incarcerated.&rdquo; The Paraphrase Database would be an automatically built log of these phrases and words with similar meanings. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The way they plan to go about identifying parallel text is through two levels of translation. First, they would translate the word &ldquo;incarcerated&rdquo; into another language, say Spanish. Often times, once a word or phrase is translated, it takes on a different literal meaning in that language. By translating back to English, the different literal meaning would be captured. So, the word &ldquo;incarcerated&rdquo; may literally mean &ldquo;thrown in jail&rdquo; in some other language, and translating it back would make the paraphrase equality apparent.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Paraphrase Database is just one component in the realm of Natural Language Processing that CCB works in. He has one PhD student working on clustering synonyms across languages. He has another student working on simplifying text for different levels of reading. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Perhaps the most interesting project they are working on is a universal translation machine. Currently, the languages that can be machine translated are based off of text that already has human translation in at least two languages. The current machines then learn patterns that human translators establish. This new translator would theoretically not need any prior human translation in order to determine a pattern for machine translation. This process is called Zero Shot Learning.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The machine starts by taking a language, say English, and mapping the words into a vector space. In this space, words like &ldquo;house&rdquo; and &ldquo;home&rdquo; are close to each other based on some criteria that determines they are synonyms. Then, in an alien language, their words for &ldquo;house&rdquo; and &ldquo;home&rdquo; will also be close to each other in their own, isolated vector space. The crux of the algorithm would then be to take these two spaces and &ldquo;learn a mapping&rdquo; between them. The machine can then translate any language to any other language with no external data.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Derry&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s work so far has been dedicated to pushing the boundaries of the field.

It&rsquo;s difficult to call that city yours, to acquire a passion for its ventures that mimics the local&rsquo;s. When Lindsay Tsai came to Philly, she had no idea it would become her home, her workplace, and her new passion all in one.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Lindsay Tsai is a Penn Engineering graduate originally from Southern California. During the college application process, she wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what she was looking for in a school, but when she traveled to the east coast and set foot on Penn&rsquo;s campus, she was hooked. She loved the environment, and how it was close enough to Philly to be connected to it. She didn&rsquo;t have a defined goal for her career path when she started her freshman year at Penn.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;At Penn, everyone seems to know what they want, but I had no idea what I wanted to do.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">She ended up pursuing an engineering degree with a minor in engineering entrepreneurship, but it was ultimately in her sophomore year that she made a decision about her engineering career path.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to do industry engineering, but instead use my engineering skills in a different way.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The summer after her sophomore year, Lindsay worked for a non-profit in the Philippines called International Care ministries. She said the experience increased her skills with social contacts, project management, and working on a team. &nbsp;She learned a lot about herself and the nonprofit world and how it functions differently than normal business world.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After her junior year, Lindsay still did not want to follow the Google or consulting internship path that was becoming so common to Penn engineers. She instead chose her own road and started working at a video-advertising startup in Venice Beach called Zefr. At her internship, she discovered that startups had the time and the passion to invest in their employees. She was able to meet amazing people who helped her grow as an employee and person during her experience. It was then that she started to fall in love with the startup scene.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Even though she loved her taste of the startup world, Lindsay was still not completely sold on pursuing that career path. A lot of people from her sorority and professional engineering fraternity who she considered very similar to her went on to work at consulting firms like Deloitte post graduation. She knew that they loved it there, so she decided to give it a shot. She went through recruitment and got hired by Deloitte as an aerospace consultant.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">She knew within the first 2 months of working in aerospace that it was not at all for her. Luckily, her position at the company moved into working with the healthcare innovation group.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thankful for the senior manager [of the healthcare innovation group] who took a chance on me.

After some time at Deloitte, Lindsay knew she wanted a change of pace. She wanted to stop traveling a lot and have more of a home base. A friend of a friend introduced her to a new opportunity &ndash; running the Philly Startup Leaders accelerator.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Philly&rsquo;s startup scene was not really on Lindsay&rsquo;s radar in college. It was when she started working for the Philly Startup Leaders organization that saw how emerging the space really was.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;It was a rejuvenating experience to work at PSL.

At PSL, she was leading all of the programming, which included an accelerator that ran in the winter through spring, the fall startup boot camp, and the summer fellowship. She built relationships with people in startups and connected them with other people that could help their venture.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It was through this process that she met the company <a href=\"https://www.rideroundtrip.com/\">Roundtrip</a></span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">a platform to simplify the nonemergency transportation space. This company went through the PSL accelerator, so Lindsay worked with them closely. She was with them when they signed first client and when they began to make hires.

She&rsquo;s ecstatic to be with the person of her dreams, but weddings aren&rsquo;t as easy as saying &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; In the chaos of planning, she and her fiance want to register with all the stores they know and love. But their guests also want to see all their registries at the press of a button, rather than comb through registries at multiple stores. Jenny Lefcourt, a Stanford MBA student at the time, saw a way to address these needs with emerging e-commerce technology.</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-6adbeb28-b5a8-979d-7cfe-3f82315714a1\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">She and fellow student were competing in a business plan competition with an idea that would not only help out your aunt, but also revolutionize the wedding industry. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">With positive feedback from judges, Jenny grew excited with the prospect of transforming her plan into a real venture. Then came in a term sheet for $1 million from Kleiner Perkins, a renowned venture capital firm. Shortly after, Jenny and her partner, Jessica, dropped out of business school and co-founded Della &amp; James, a service that leveraged the internet to aggregate gift registries across several partner retailers. It enabled couples to physically register at stores, like Crate &amp; Barrel, Williams Sonoma, Neiman Marcus, and more. Wedding guests could then buy from the registries online.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Jenny made clear the necessity to understand consumer behavior, a lesson highly applicable to today&rsquo;s technologically accelerating world. While pitching to investors, Jenny rejected advice to follow the Amazon model of bypassing retailers by intermediating the industry. Why?</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Just because the technology is there doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the market is ready for it!&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Indeed, brides and grooms were not ready to register online, not to mention at an unestablished website. Couples in the late &lsquo;90s loved the experience of physically registering at stores and attendees still valued the experience of physically buying gifts. Jenny&rsquo;s business acumen and attention to her market helped Della &amp; James to successfully: </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Synchronize couples&rsquo; registries across multiple stores</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Allow wedding guests to search for a couple&rsquo;s registry online and see what gifts the couple had registered for, at which stores</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Update the registry with what guests had bought, both on and offline, so that there would be no logistical issues</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">With its success, Della &amp; James merged with WeddingChannel in 2001 and the company was later acquired by theknot.com for approximately $90 million. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Jenny then stepped down and left the fast-paced, entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley lifestyle. But not for long. She soon co-founded Bella Pictures, which became the first national wedding photography brand. &ldquo;We would match our couples with the best wedding photographers, process images, and send albums back to consumers for $3000, which would have otherwise costed $6000 if they tried to do what we did by themselves,&rdquo; Jenny said. Then, the company&rsquo;s trajectory hit a wall.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We went from $0 to $20 million in under 3 years, which was insane. And then,&rdquo; she paused, recollecting, &ldquo;it was 2008. VCs were not writing checks. 2008, &rdquo; Jenny sighed, &ldquo;...no one knew what the hell was going on. The world was frozen.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Bella Pictures couldn&rsquo;t grow anymore. The entire wedding industry was collapsing around it. Entrepreneurs like Jenny are continuously faced with the uphill battle of disrupting markets; their success lies in their ability to see clearly and continue climbing.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;It was </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">super</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> stressful. Entrepreneurs don&rsquo;t want to blame outside factors. We want to think we&rsquo;re in charge of our failures. But the reality was that our whole industry had collapsed ... We ended up selling our company.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">But Jenny&rsquo;s infectious enthusiasm for startups, disruption, and good ideas continued even after Bella Pictures. She became an investor for Freestyle VC, one of the top-tier seed stage firms in Silicon Valley, and still works there today. Freestyle has invested in companies like Airtable, mLab, Patreon, Intercom, and Wag. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After asking Jenny whether she invests in the wedding industry, she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised! I don&rsquo;t know weddings. What I know is business and founders. I know how to make something from nothing.&rdquo; Even after starting two successful ventures in the wedding space, Jenny prefers to keep an open mind by investing in everything from SaaS companies to real-estate tech startups. Her energy bubbled as she spoke about the lasting relationships she&rsquo;s made by hustling alongside founders to develop their businesses and raise funding. Freestyle VC, a firm complete with three investors and one operations manager, is gearing up to invest out of their 4th fund at $90 million. Jenny helps fund roughly four companies per year with the sole vision to &ldquo;find people to invest in and make them successful.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Today, Jenny is a fantastic VC who empowers founders to materialize their dreams. But the road to get here started before she helped found Della &amp; James, and Bella Pictures. Getting to her current state of self-assurance took a leap of faith - one in which she revolted against the easy, readily available, and well-travelled path. As an undergrad from Wharton, Jenny was set to work for Arthur Andersen, a top accounting firm at the time. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I remember crying the night before I started at Arthur Andersen. It&rsquo;s not that I knew what I wanted to do, but I had no desire to become an accountant. I asked myself, &lsquo;How did I get here?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">So she quit, backpacked for a year, moved to Silicon Valley, and joined MySoftware Company. She soon fell in love with the area&rsquo;s characteristic entrepreneurial spirit, a resonating quality she would not have found in accounting. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Jenny&rsquo;s decision to not settle for that accounting position speaks to her determination to question the easy, comfortable paths in life. &ldquo;Being unafraid,&rdquo; she said, is what lets her find and wholeheartedly pursue her passions. It can feel as though making gutsy decisions can have lasting impact. But Jenny described her mentality as, &ldquo;if this doesn&rsquo;t work out, I can always wait tables.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In the end, she left me with some beautiful advice for college students and myself.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Try not to follow the path of least resistance. Try to think about what excites you. Try to respect that your most limited resource is time. If you do want to go to work in finance because you&rsquo;ve thought about it and you&rsquo;re passionate about it, that&rsquo;s great! But, don&rsquo;t just take the job because it&rsquo;s the easy thing to do - that&rsquo;s a mistake. That&rsquo;s what I did! Make very conscious choices because life is short.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>",

While Abhi was working at Apollo Global Management, a fancy private equity firm with an office overlooking Central Park, Edward was helping out with Helios, one of their &ldquo;side-projects&rdquo; at the time. Every day, Abhi would go to work at 7:30AM and come back at 10PM and every day Edward would tell Abhi to quit his job. Helios just couldn&rsquo;t make it as a side-project. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Abhi, this is going to be huge.

His hesitation was understandable; he had a well-paying job and, last time Abhi took a risk this large, it didn&rsquo;t exactly cash out to be the &ldquo;next big thing.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Abhi and Darwish, old high school friends, were back in town from Penn and Northwestern respectively for Thanksgiving break. Abhi, a 2400-SAT-score student and responsible older sibling, was helping his younger brother prepare for the exam. Interestingly, Darwish was </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">also</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> tutoring students for the SAT. In discussing SAT prep, they realized they could provide a better product than the hundreds of test-prep books that littered the industry. They wanted to create personalized test preparation paths for students optimized to their skill levels. Then, during their sophomore year of college, Altair Prep was born. After 1 month of creating a reasonable game-plan, the work needed to grow Altair grew exponentially. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;The variables add up very quickly.

It&rsquo;s important to note here that Abhi&rsquo;s work ethic and love for dense, hard work enabled him to conduct research and pursue two degrees, all the while expanding his test-prep start up. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Just after their first seven months categorizing thousands of test questions, hiring tutors, onboarding students, and booking class space, Altair prep was in 4 cities and had a team of 10 and 60 students enrolled in the program.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Soon, a menacing problem loomed over Altair. Abhi and Darwish&rsquo;s tutors couldn&rsquo;t efficiently work with the many spreadsheets the company used to store testing information and questions. They needed software tools for their tutors and a software platform for their students. With no one on the team with software skills, Altair used freelance developers and even hired a CTO - all strategies that didn&rsquo;t work because </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">hiring is hard</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It&rsquo;s now the summer before Abhi&rsquo;s junior year of college.

Some rails tutorials, &ldquo;side-projects,&rdquo; and hackathons later, he moved to LA to work with two angel investors who saw promise in his projects at the time. During his stay in California, Abhi worked for 9 months on 30-40 different projects, returned to school, graduated, and started at Apollo. Meanwhile, Darwish had been busy programming at a coding bootcamp and then started at Optimizely. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Seeing the companies we invested in at Apollo, I realized that I now had the skills to literally build those companies&rsquo; products.

The time you put into things early in your life compounds quickly. The people I knew in college who focused from day one are incredibly successful in their respective fields. The tricky thing with college is that the way universities are structured, students are encouraged to explore a lot to find their passion. I think you have to explore to a certain extent to find out what path to take. However, often times, students end up exploring too much - for four full years. They leave college just as confused as they came in. College ends, real life begins, and they don&rsquo;t have an idea of the path they want to take, nor the deep skills to do well on any given path. My personal view is that passion is idealized and possibly overrated. I think passion can develop as being very good at something. Identify your path early and gun down that path.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>",

The words hang in the air of the second story brick building that houses Ampush, a digital marketing firm based in San Francisco. Jesse Pujji, one of the three cofounders, believes this is what lies at the core of exponential growth in a company. Traditionally, companies would spend two months developing a 30 second ad to put on TV. They would only be able to see the results of the campaign after six months of running the ad. &ldquo;Now we can do that whole process in under an hour.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-351f9680-3b97-b2cc-9110-21c7ebe08160\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In the eyes of Ampush, the marketing cycle is entirely data driven. &ldquo;I know there are users on their phones, google searching, on Facebook, on Instagram. In order to get those users I need tech. I need data. Now I need a quantitative analyst rather than a marketing guy.&rdquo; With the data in hand, Ampush devises a foolproof end-to-end marketing campaign for the product. From the moment a user sees an ad all the way to purchase, Ampush can help personalize the process. &ldquo;We occupy that whole horizontal layer of the process,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;This is the secret sauce that makes the biggest companies work.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Nowadays, big data is a trend that consumers are weary of. Online profiles and targeted ads are just few of the examples of the impact of our digital footprint. Ampush was one of the early adopters of this trend. &ldquo;We were one of the first people to figure out Facebook advertising in 2010 and 2011.&rdquo; They bet big on the growth of Facebook and it paid dividends. They later added data-driven approaches to advertising through Instagram, Snapchat, Google Ads, and Pinterest.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The journey he took with his cofounders to start Ampush began long before the creation of the company, however. They first met a year before college at Leadership in the Business World (LBW), a Wharton program for high school seniors. Over the course of their summer together, Nick Shah, Chris Amos, and Jesse grew to be close friends and closer still as roommates in the Quad their freshman year. &nbsp;The following summer, Jesse worked as a leader for the same program they met at and was whipped back to the entrepreneurial mindset that drove him through the rest of his college life.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Jesse, Nick, and Chris became serial entrepreneurs from sophomore year onwards. They started the Facebook equivalent for high school students, getting up to 50,000 users at its peak. They created their own version of BleacherReport at some point too. &ldquo;We had the type of idea that you could work at a business then drop it if things weren&rsquo;t going so well.&rdquo; They soon realized they weren&rsquo;t getting anywhere. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Their most successful college venture was the one they stuck with the longest: a t-shirt company. They saw the opportunity in selling to freshmen, who were bound to buy Penn apparel in their first few weeks at college. The team designed and ordered 400 unofficial class t-shirts, and marketed through listserv emails to get pre orders. Within a week, they were sold out. After more sales during NSO, the trio made a total of $5,000 over the first couple weeks of their sophomore year. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We took half the earnings and divided it up amongst themselves. Then we took the other half, put it in a bank account, and incorporated a company.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s how trio became official. The group pushed through failed orders, printing inconsistencies, and delivery deadlines to grow the business and provide for as many clubs across campus as possible. By the end of their college careers, they were doing about $100,000 in annual revenue, &ldquo;enough to not do work study,&rdquo; Jesse added. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Though his cofounders were a massive influence on his growth as an entrepreneur since an early age, Jesse was insistent on another aspect of the serial entrepreneur: tenacity. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s urgency, it&rsquo;s aggression, and it&rsquo;s perseverance and determination.

Not only do you have to move against obstacles, you have to move with haste. That&rsquo;s the secret sauce - not &ldquo;never give up&rdquo;, rather &ldquo;keep moving faster&rdquo;.</span></p>",

I asked Jacob what prompted him to create Arena of Ares:</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I really wanted to play a game that was like a mix between Skyrim and an MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game). The problem with Skyrim is that its single player in a huge world so the player feels sort of isolated. The problem with MMORPGs is that there tends to be a lot of unfair or malicious gameplay. I was looking for a game exactly like Arena of Ares, but there was nothing really like it on current gen systems.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Arena of Ares was developed using Unreal Engine 4 and C++. With over 100 quadrillion different character build options, the game lends itself to extremely unique gameplay scenarios. When asked what feature of the game he was most proud of, Jacob thought silently for several seconds before mentioning the telekinesis spell.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;The telekinesis spell picks up the enemy mage and puts him at a user-specified location. The control wheel on your mouse picks up the specified object and brings it in by bringing the set point closer to the player. The game engine will then put a force on the player in the direction of the set point by using a PID (proportional integral derivative) controller. I spent 2 days programming all of that in C++.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">There were numerous other related challenges that Jacob faced while developing Arena of Ares. Among these included networking physics over a game engine. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;As a user, you don&rsquo;t really think about this, but there are time lags in games. Beginning in the early 90&rsquo;s, there's been a lot of research on how to create fluid player experience where you feel like you are playing over a local area network, but you&rsquo;re actually playing over a WAN (wide area network). I managed to make physics-heavy spells, like the telekinesis spell, work with up to 200ms ping and only 1% packet loss, which was really hard to do.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The game also includes hundreds of other interesting combat features of varying complexity. The massive scope of Arena of Ares led Jacob and Theo to spend a large chunk of the summer brainstorming and developing the game. &ldquo;After we decided to work on creating the game, my dad allowed us to use his office space for the development of the game, which was very useful. We finished what we would call the &lsquo;pre-alpha&rsquo; version by the end of the summer in his office.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The time commitment for the project was not light. Jacob and Theo sometimes spent up to 13-14 hours a day working on the game. With such a heavy initial time investment, Jacob doesn&rsquo;t plan to stop working on Arena of Ares anytime soon. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I want to make it big.

If his stretch goals are reached, Jacob wants to implement other features like tournament modes, new spells, and playability on other devices.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Jacob started creating games in 7th grade using <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a> and understands the challenges that aspiring game developers face when they begin creating their first game. In high-school, he created a game development club to teach other students how develop their own games.

His face is smeared with small flecks of neon paint, remainders of the typical college weekend festivities. You probably wouldn&rsquo;t guess that he has ten apps on the Apple app store either. They range from educational technology platforms that have been categorically ranked as high as #2 on the app store </span><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">in Education</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, to the Tesla app that earned him his internship in Penn alumni Elon Musk&rsquo;s company. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This accomplished student&rsquo;s story starts with his first app: nothing more than an 8th grade science project. While his classmates made informational posters, songs, board games, and mini movies depicting the lunar phases of the moon, Diamond made an app called MyMoonPhase that went above and beyond the criteria. &ldquo;It was the night before the assignment was due,&rdquo; Diamond laughs, &ldquo;and I hadn&rsquo;t done the assignment yet, so I just decided to create an iPhone app without really knowing what to do, just piecing together random pieces of knowledge.&rdquo; <span style=\"font-size: 18.6667px;\">MyMoonPhase</span> was a user-interactive learning platform that soon aggregated social traction in Diamond&rsquo;s school, teaching his classmates about waxing crescent and waning gibbous moons. From there, he began scouring YouTube for app development tutorials to build his way up from small programming tasks to bigger and more elaborate projects. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Diamond&rsquo;s second app would be the catalyst for some of his most popular existing apps. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I was driving home from school one day with my mom and she asked how I did on a test. I told her that I had to wait until I got home to check on the computer and she was like &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no app for that?&rsquo; which was the start to my second app, the grades system app.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The iOS grade-tracking environment ultimately became known as myHAC, and not only allows students to track their grades, but also highlights subjects of academic weakness and sends notifications for assignments and tests. myHAC&rsquo;s usage quickly expanded from Diamond&rsquo;s high school to a nationwide scale, aggregating over 175,000 downloads across the country and reaching #2 in the iOS App Store under Paid Educational apps and #45 overall in Paid. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Since myHAC, Diamond has built a diverse portfolio of works with increasingly impressive momentum. The Inkling News app and iStaples app joined myHAC in Diamond&rsquo;s line of educational tech works. Another app, Saround, emerged through collaboration with another entrepreneur to create immediate labor pools for local jobs such as babysitting, yard work, and errands. His most recent iOS app Tesla Toolbox, used by over 4000 Tesla owners worldwide, is an extension of the existing Tesla app and allows complete control of the vehicle directly from an Apple Watch. Its other features include the ability to record and view trip statistics complete with graphs, Touch-ID authorization to remotely start the car, and is currently the only third party Tesla App to have a working summon and homelink feature. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Diamond&rsquo;s brand has now solidified under the name of Diamond Apps LLC, but despite the umbrella creator name, Diamond firmly believes that &ldquo;each app has its own audience, each app has its own suite of features, so each app in a way is its own startup, its own business.&rdquo; This vision means that Diamond is constantly working to maintain and improve his existing apps, in addition to creating new ones. &ldquo;When Tesla customers reach out to me, they want new features</span><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Lora, serif;\">&mdash;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Lora, serif; white-space: pre-wrap;\">and when people want new features, that&rsquo;s how you know that your product is successful and engaging the customers with your service,&rdquo; he explains. Diamond responds promptly to feedback from his users, often making the changes they request: &ldquo;When you implement those new features and email the customer back saying &lsquo;Hey check out the update, your feature request should be in there,&rsquo; and they&rsquo;re very responsive back, that&rsquo;s gratifying.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">But being a young entrepreneur is not an endeavor without challenges<span style=\"color: #222222; white-space: normal;\">&mdash;</span>Diamond&rsquo;s high school life was spent alternating between apps, homework, and a pool of extracurriculars, which translated into many late nights spent working.

As a student, especially when building scheduling and grading tools, it&rsquo;s important to know &lsquo;what information do I want to see first, and how do I present the information in the fewest number of taps and in a simplified way, not showing too much detail where it&rsquo;s not needed.&rsquo;\"</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">His work has largely been successful, reaching an expansive audience across the nation.

He posture was poised and firm, establishing his authority in the room from the very start&mdash;probably a result of all the boxing and mixed martial arts that carved discipline into the depths of his soul. The way he talks and acts is friendly and inviting, and he seems like your average guy; but when you listen closely to what he says, you realize that Mayank thinks on a different plane. It&rsquo;s easy to tell that the unique lens through which he views the world has crafted him into who his is today. It was clear that the source of this unbreakable confidence and inner strength was his journey&mdash;a journey of discovering one&rsquo;s position in the world to the desire for the power to make change.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">He&rsquo;s always been perceptive when it came to privilege. Since he was little, he understood the fact that &ldquo;being guaranteed a meal at home, not having to worry about a ride to school the next day, and going to a reputable school&rdquo; was something that can&rsquo;t be taken for granted. He saw the importance of simply &ldquo;placing the situation in context,&rdquo; and put great value to his own privilege. That is where Mayank believes the true heart of his entrepreneurial spirit lies&mdash;in how one&rsquo;s current position affects &ldquo;where the motivation, the drive comes from.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">He found his own drive through a squid. When he was in second grade, he joined a coding challenge camp that made games. At first, none of it made much sense; he was connecting a right arrow key to a function, right mouse click to a class, and throwing in odd-looking structures that made no sense in English. But when the program compiled, he pieced together what he made: a squid samurai sword fighting game. He could press keys on the keyboard to make squids slide around the screen and swing massive Japanese swords at one another. To the average adult, it would look like a crazy, basic game to entertain a little kid for a while; but to him, it was just like getting free front-row Kendrick tickets without giving your social security &ldquo;for contacting purposes.&rdquo; The sheer volume of the things he could create with this new power made him want to discover as much as he could. He loved the ability to build with his own hands, and realized that he now had the power to spark change in his life and the lives of people around him. His imagination is limitless&mdash;and with a tool like programming, he could engineer a solution to nearly anything in the world.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When he started becoming very skilled at coding, Mayank tried his best to use his newfound powers to make positive change. His first project was to get some free Chinese food. A nearby Chinese restaurant had a very outdated website, and Mayank, seeing an opportunity to put his talents to use, decided to lend a helping hand. One success led to another, and before long he had both free Chinese food for life and a website consulting firm that helped small businesses redesign their online platforms. He then branched out to begin a non-profit called Peerlift with his good friend, Sam Gorman. Peerlift is an organization that helps low to middle income students find applicable scholarships, internships, and opportunities. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;For most kids, going to college is the incarnation of the American dream.

His boxing coach used to always tell him to &ldquo;fight smart, not hard.&rdquo; He learned the meaning behind these words when he began coding a new, massive project last summer. Making a large-scale app &ldquo;is a consuming process&hellip;[and it was] something that I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for,&rdquo; says Mayank. He would spend 10+ hours programming daily. And when Penn started, it was clear that the massive burden of keeping a business alive while juggling a CIS degree was infeasible. Since Sam is going to Stanford, Mayank and his partner met some difficulty in meeting expectations while being good students and upholding active social lives. As a result, there was only one option: sell. Although he was sad to not call it his anymore, he&rsquo;s learned that being an entrepreneur has its price&mdash;and next time, he&rsquo;ll fight smarter by weighing the expectations from the get-go.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">His journey isn&rsquo;t over yet, and &ldquo;next time&rdquo; seems just around the corner. He&rsquo;s still creating and building, and he says &ldquo;building for myself...is what makes me happy.&rdquo; Here at Penn, he&rsquo;s looking to hone his programming expertise and possibly pursue another startup. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I want to have a consistent impact on things I wants to have an impact on without having to worry about the influence of others.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">He&rsquo;s still practicing, hustling for the opportunity to one day &ldquo;not have to answer to another authority.&rdquo; One day, he wants to be powerful enough to create change for the world.

He sees entrepreneurship as a vehicle to turn frustrations about the human condition into real solutions. With a voracious appetite for reading and business acumen, Lando drives his mission-oriented ventures night and day.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Context must be provided before stepping too far into Lando&rsquo;s current life as an entrepreneur. He grew up in Paris, France spending most of his days reading humanistic fiction such as Narcissus and Goldmund by Hermann Hesse.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lucky in that I have much older parents.

Lando loved learning about the different cultures of the world from his father, a journalist.

Interestingly, though he decided to enroll in the Huntsman program at the University of Pennsylvania, he never gave up his love for literature. In addition to his dual degree in business and humanities, Lando took many courses in computer science, psychology, and Spanish literature.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pile on the majors and minors.

He started roughly forty different web-based projects after teaching himself Ruby on Rails, a popular web framework.

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">It all started with an anatomy class and a turtle; a turtle which just may have inspired the next big revolution in biotechnology. Sitting in that anatomy and physiology class, bored with dissections, a teenage Karen Hogan stared at a turtle swimming around in its tank. As she watched the reptile float through the water, Hogan realized that instead of cutting open a dead cat \"for science,\" she would rather being interacting with living organisms in their natural habitats. This desire to step out of the lab and get her hands dirty is what helped transform Karen Hogan, the high school student, into Dr. Hogan, the chief scientist at Biorealize, a company reshaping the forefront of synthetic biology. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">Hogan didn&rsquo;t always envision herself as an academic. After deciding she wanted to pursue a nature-based career, Hogan matriculated to the University of Dayton to pursue a degree in environmental biology. Instead of just sitting in class learning out of a book, Hogan spent much of her time in the field. She&nbsp;studied geology in the mountains of Colorado, and instrumentation biology in the wetlands of Florda. After college, Hogan joined the Academy of Natural Sciences as a field biologist&nbsp;to map stream quality around Philadelphia and the surrounding regions. She soon realized, however, that to progress in science she would need a PhD, and so she came to Penn to earn her doctorate in microbial and stream ecology. Hogan, who has always embraced chaos, spent half her PhD chasing storms. This unique ability to mix field work and bench work has become invaluable to her career as an educator at Penn and entrepreneur at Biorealize. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">The story of Biorealize began when Dr. Orkan Telhan, a professor in the School of Design, approached Dr. Greg Guild, then-chair of the biology department, looking for laboratory space. The unorthodox request came from Telhan&rsquo;s desire to teach his design students synthetic biology. When people hear design, they tend to think of fine arts and digital media, but design is about transforming any medium to give it meaning and provide human benefit. Telhan believed that with&nbsp;synthetic biology as their tool, his&nbsp;students could use life both as a source of inspiration and as a new medium. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">When Hogan heard about this ambitious request, she obliged. Little did she know, the ensuing partnership would last much longer than one semester and eventually come to redefine her teaching career. One of Telhan&rsquo;s plans was to show his students how to genetically transform bacteria to make them glow, a procedure which Hogan had performed countless times with students. This time, however was different. Instead of working with students interested in careers as researchers, physicians, and engineers, Hogan was teaching designers who might never have stepped into a life sciences laboratory before. It was a moment of inspiration and beauty for her, seeing the transformation of artists into biotechnologists. This idea would become a principal goal of Biorealize&rsquo;s microbial design studio. When the two instructors met afterwards in Hogan&rsquo;s office, Telhan made some suggestions to improve an electrical setup Hogan was toying with for her class. Hogan had an epiphany:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">\"It was that exact moment that he and I really realized that there was this balance of expertise that we could bring together to pursue novel applications of biology and design.\"</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Believing that a symbiotic relationship could exist between art and science, the two set off to create a novel class that was unheard of in undergraduate education. They envisioned natural science, engineering, and fine arts students collaborating to design new biological applications and works of art. There were massive challenges in trying to teach students with different skillsets, interests, and expertise who thought about problems differently and essentially spoke different languages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">But Telhan and Hogan remained undeterred. They sought insight from other professors during the process of creating the course, learning where there should be more science and where there should be more design. The process involved constant learning, as each instructor dived into the other partner&rsquo;s field of study. As the class took shape, the two professors continually looked for ways to improve their teaching by &ldquo;reinventing and recalibrating the course&rdquo; over the first two years. They took in feedback from students and peers, constantly reevaluated their teaching methodology, and adapted to changing circumstances. While they may not have realized it, the process of experimentation, iterative design, and validated learning they went through to create FNAR-268 is essentially the lean startup process. By creating Integrative Design Studio: Biological Design the unlikely pair had become entrepreneurs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In creating the successful course, both Hogan and Telhan constantly had to figure out new ways to simplify the learning curve for students and make science a less time-intensive process. Students with zero prerequisite knowledge had one semester to understand synthetic biology and manipulate it to design something brand-new, not six years to write a thesis on one topic. Biorealize is the next step in furthering Hogan and Telhan&rsquo;s goal of &nbsp;accelerating biological innovation by removing the tedium from research to make science more accessible and productive.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">So much of our training goes into teaching people how to move small volumes of liquids around to make these discoveries, and that ends up wasting a lot of time for highly trained people who would rather spend their time thinking about experiments, designing experiments, [and] designing new applications. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Hogan has made it her mission to solve this productivity crisis by lowering the barriers of entry into biotechnology and automating time-intensive processes. With the help of Telhan, Hogan realized that anyone could be a participant in biology. She spent six years earning her PhD because it was the only way for her to advance in science, and there was currently no entry point for the regular citizen to interact with biology or have any input into scientific discovery. Biologists were academics and professional researchers who spent years in multimillion dollar laboratories conducting experiments, pursuing grants, and publishing results in academic journals. The path towards scientific discovery was agonizingly slow, where one had to spend years learning highly specialized skills in a niche area of focus in order to gain the requisite knowledge and credibility needed to run a research lab. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Through Telhan, Hogan was introduced to the world of people involved in synthetic biology. One of those people was veteran process engineer Mike Hogan (unrelated), an&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;\">amateur biohacker and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">avid kombucha brewer. He joined the two Penn professors to create Biorealize, a microbial design studio with the goal of&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;\">automating biology and</span><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;enabling biotechnology to make a massive productivity leap. The studio is designed to work in tandem with researchers to allow them design and interact with experiments without constant monitoring and input. It achieves this by automatic transformation, incubation, spectrophotometry, centrifugation, and more.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Researchers go through a long, manual process to genetically manipulate bacteria. They first have to potentially dilute a solution of bacteria and incorporate synthetic DNA into their genomes. After this, they must incubate the bacteria under precise conditions with constant monitoring of the experimental variable. Since a single individual can only do one thing at a time, these manual processes waste thousands of hours and lead to many late nights in the lab. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">With Biorealize's&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">microbial design studio, users can insert up to eight different DNA solutions and eight different host organism solutions to test multiple conditions at the same time. On their computers, users design experimental procedures by determining incubation time, temperature, and other relevant conditions. The machine then electroporates the cells, creating a current that makes bacterial membranes porous enough for experimental DNA to flow into the cell. From there the DNA incorporates into the cell and the organisms are fed with media to keep them healthy. The machine can mix in any antibiotics or inducers that the user specifies before incubating the bacteria. The incubation carousel can heat, cool, and shake the samples to meet precise incubation criteria. Furthermore it can constantly monitor the bacteria through a spectrophotometer and other sensors to measure bacterial growth and the expression of different phenotypes for which the user is testing. After incubation, the organisms are mixed with reagents to inactivate them, and are transferred to vials where they can then centrifuged and further analyzed. This process relieves a massive bottleneck in biological research, but its importance goes far beyond that.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">\"The big moment came when we realized that it could be more than just a piece of hardware because you could connect the devices to one another [and] we could actually make it easier for scientists and product designers to collaborate...\"</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"> The microbial design studios are all networked, allowing users to an experiment across different devices. Instead of just running two setups in the same room, users from across the world could run the experiments in parallel and share their results with each other to collaborate on biological innovation. The system records the exact procedure and all the data it collects during incubation, which allows for instantly repeatable experiments. If the user chooses to share the results, they can be&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 18.6667px;\">analyzed and v</span>erified by anyone in the world. This creates the potential for generating a massive informational library that anyone can access. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Imagine Biorealize as GitHub for biology. People around the world share their experiments and results, instead of sharing code. Others could view these protocols, download them, and run the experiments on their own. Furthermore, users could modify each others&rsquo; protocols to improve procedures or fix experiments without ever having to visit a lab in another part of the world. One could combine elements of different experimental procedures to create a novel protocol.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;\">Without even owning a physical device,</span><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;\">&nbsp;one could test a</span><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;protocol on a device anywhere around the world and have the results uploaded onto a server. This essentially creates an AWS analog where a user does not even need to own their own design studio to conduct experiments, and could instead \"rent studio time\" and pay another individual or organization who owns a device to conduct the experiment for them. Even better, anyone would be able to access published data from thousands of experiments to analyze the results and formulate new theories. These theories could then be tested on any microbial design studio, and be put to use by designers creating novel applications.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Biorealize doesn't just make research more productive for researchers who can run hundreds of experiments at the same time. It completely tears down the barriers to entry in biology, from both an expertise and a capital perspective. Users would not need laboratory experience to investigate new applications, and would be able to download or design new procedures and let the microbial design studio take care of the brunt of the work after that. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Biorealize is improving the efficiency and output of laboratories, as well as allowing biology to be taken out of the lab and placed into the hands of designers, innovators, and citizen scientists. The result could be the next big productivity shift in biotechnology, and the migration of research from the lab into the market faster than ever before.&nbsp;</span></span></p>",

In this game, you are a private investigator in an immersive and action-packed world of financial crime and must use skills such as evidence gathering, transaction tracing, mutual legal assistance requests, and asset forfeiture to solve a case. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This kind of video game-based learning is the vision Chris Bennett, CEO of Skyless Game Studios, imagined when he first began the company. Skyless Game Studios is a social impact, education, and philanthropy-oriented video game company, with games ranging from City Hall, a city management game, to Assemble It, a puzzle game for families with one or more children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Skyless Game Studios differentiates itself from other transformative video game companies in its field by partnering with organizations to create their games.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;There are a lot big missions, social causes and different organizations like non-profit organizations, social enterprises, individual experts, and researchers who want to make games. They&rsquo;re interested in using games in order to educate people, to change their thinking and behavior, and to have a positive impact on the world around them, so we dedicated ourselves to being a resource that helps these people achieve their social impact goals.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The roots of Skyless Game Studios are deeply ingrained in Drexel, as Bennett is a Drexel University graduate who studied business with a concentration in marketing and entrepreneurship. His work in philanthropy in his fraternity Pi Kappa Phi led him to meet one his co-founders, Drexel finance and entrepreneurship graduate Oleks Levtchenko, while his other co-founder Arad Malhotra was a student in Drexel&rsquo;s National Computer Science Honors Society.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Skyless Game Studios began as a small side project for Bennett and his team while at Drexel. It was funded by an entrepreneurship incubator run by the university, and the team&rsquo;s first project was called Project Empathy. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We initially started with a principle focus on creating our own intellectual property,&rdquo; Bennett recalls, &ldquo;with our games addressing different controversial topics. Our very first game [Project Empathy] was actually about the psychology behind radicalization, and the thesis behind that concept was that being able to understand other people is a way to solve problems.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Shortly after their work on Project Empathy, Skyless Game Studios received their first request for a customized video game- a game about corruption that would launch Skyless Game Studios into its present-day arena of client-based transformative gaming. This game became known as Follow the Money, and from the experience of working on Follow the Money, Bennett and his team soon began to shape the mission of Skyless Game Studios.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;A memorable moment from a few years back that I think really helped solidify what we were doing occurred while we were working on Follow the Money and were invited to present it at the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. At the event, we were meeting people from all sort of countries from corruption experts to policymakers, and it was pretty fascinating, seeing the different voices from different positions with respect to corruption.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, the path for client-based video game creation proved to have its own challenges for Bennett and his team.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We decided to take a bit of an usual approach in the technology space to our model, especially in that we&rsquo;re a service-based organization. A lot of startups focus on developing a MVP product and raise investment based on that, while we have principally funded ourselves through our sales. There are pros and cons to each approach, but I definitely think that early on, we were eating ramen and scratching by as best we could. It took a while to get referrals and to get our base growing. We kind of couldn&rsquo;t afford to have great social lives early on and basically worked for a lot less, initially for free, than a typical 9 to 5 job. &ldquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Building a customer base and portfolio of works to attract new clients took time and work, but looking back on the model decision, Bennett believes that it was the right decision for Skyless Game Studios.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We went to another conference called Games for Change in New York before we were on our current model of service business where we&rsquo;re focusing on working with other parties to make games, and this event was a big reason why we decided to shift towards this model. We were there with people coming from NGOs and social enterprises, and they had these cool ideas and initiatives that they thought games would be a great platform for, but they didn&rsquo;t have the ability to make it themselves.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Skyless Game Studios is now thriving, with a growing portfolio of video games and a strong team. &ldquo;We have a light-hearted approach to our work,&rdquo; Bennett says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re serious about our results, but we also have a lot of fun doing it because there are many opportunities for creativity and artistic expression within the games we&rsquo;re designing.&rdquo; The nature of Skyless Game Studios&rsquo; work also lends itself to a unique work process that keeps Bennett and his team thinking of new ideas:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We have the interesting challenge of balancing a game that is supposed to be fun and artistic against specific business requirements, whether they&rsquo;re for social impact or for business-oriented outcomes. Especially right at the beginning of our project, it is always an interesting challenge to see how we end up going about combining all these weird requirements that don't sound fun into a fun game.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When asked whether he had a difficult decision choosing between the traditional path of post-graduation employment or continue his ventures with Skyless Game Studios, Bennett had a very clear answer, &ldquo;After graduation, I worked at both Skyless and a normal job, but I think I knew the whole time that it was my intention to break off and do my own thing. It&rsquo;s just a part of who I am and how I approach work. It was a big step, and it takes a bit of craziness to make that choice, but I think it really worked out for me.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">And for aspiring entrepreneurs, Bennett concluded with a piece of advice that ultimately reflects the spirit of Skyless Game Studios. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;As much as you need to be thoughtful about it and make sure you&rsquo;re committed, if you don&rsquo;t take a risk, you&rsquo;re not going to achieve what you want to achieve. If there&rsquo;s even a glimmer of a yes, just do it.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>",

For Chicago residents, the average ethnic grocery store is 40 minutes away, compared to the average generic grocery store which is only 10 minutes away. Boyede (B.) Sobitan and his co-founder Fola Dada have Nigerian backgrounds and are well versed on the issue. They saw this problem and founded Oja Express as a solution. Oja Express is an on-demand cultural delivery marketplace, where anyone can order groceries online or via a mobile app. </span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-0d48d80f-9d23-f888-31da-6e6728afee9d\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sobitan went to the University of Illinois-Chicago and has a background in nursing. He says his college experience helped him to bring large groups of people together and take leadership. Nursing aided him because the process involved a lot of experimentation, and this process is key when creating a startup. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When talking about future goals, Sobitan says, &ldquo;We want to be the United Nations of food.&rdquo; Oja Express is continuing to establish itself with its Washington D.C. platform that is poised for release at the end of this month. The long-term goal of Oja Express is for everyone to have access to cultural foods no matter where they are. While Amazon Fresh is just one example of other big players in the food delivery industry, Oja Express has found its niche with ethnic food. Also, most grocers are not equipped to service people in the way Oja Express does since the company allows people to keep their cultural traditions through food. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Customer feedback and stories are an essential part of how Oja Express is validated and improved. Sobitan knew he was onto something when he talked to a woman from Chicago's South Side, who used Oja Express to order cultural food for her mother. Sobitan prides his company on being &ldquo;able to help people preserve their culture no matter where they&rsquo;re from.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As of now, the two founders comprise the company's only two full-time employees, but Oja Express relies on other team support as well. Oja Express has a team in Africa that helps create content for the company. One of Sobitan&rsquo;s goals is to hire teams from all the countries that they serve their customers with.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">When reflecting back on Oja Express, Sobitan talked about what has been most meaningful to him. He said, &ldquo;The process -- the process is something that really humbles [you].&rdquo; Sobitan would tell young entrepreneurs to &ldquo;take advantage of the fact that you don&rsquo;t need a lot of resources to start.&rdquo; He also encourages students to talk to their peers and bounce ideas off them. Watch out for Oja Express, coming to a city near you soon.</span> </span></p>",

He found himself joining Abhi, Darwish, Lando and the rest of the Horizons team to help grow the code school after they had their first cohort of students in the summer of 2016. Check out our previous article on Horizons </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://penntechreview.com/read/abhiramesh\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">here</span></a><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">. Now, after the third cohort, the team is rolling out a new program: Horizons One.</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-672d6af2-9d28-3fca-8643-b7b858b3d05f\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Horizons One is the next big step for Horizons. In this model, companies sponsor the cost of a student's education in exchange for a 1-year apprenticeship.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In addition to the &ldquo;future-looking&rdquo; nature of Horizons One, their plan is full of incremental changes. Reading and analyzing daily feedback and concept trackers from their students governs the changes they make in the curriculum and the organization. The feedback also helps to keep the emphasis of the program on individuals, allowing students to achieve the curriculum at their own pace. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a you versus yourself journey,&rdquo; Sunny says. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">With students very much a part of the workplace, it&rsquo;s no wonder there is such an emphasis on individual feedback. In the case of his previous job at Workday, things were different for Sunny. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I had a lot more comfort than I realized. In my previous job I had a corner desk with a view of the bay and Bay Bridge. Free food. Now I&rsquo;m in a place where you do cool things, but also can&rsquo;t find coffee cups for the coffee.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At Workday, Sunny worked as a Product Manager for a machine learning team. His primary focus was to identify and build out use cases for machine learning application in human resources and finance. He would then tackle these proposals with different engineering teams to create their product and ship it. There were tried and true ways of working with different teams and shipping products. For example, there were routine meetings between Product and Marketing. They were also fortunate to have many talented engineers, data-scientists and designers already working at the company. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Not only was the company format easy to navigate, but the leadership structures were also superb. Even in a 4,000 employee company, &ldquo;it feels like everything is taken care of. It&rsquo;s a real testament to the experienced leadership and the way they set up the culture.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Horizons is on the other side of the spectrum.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;You see what the guts are. What&rsquo;s working and not working. You can&rsquo;t just think about it, you actually have to do something. It&rsquo;s a real humbling experience.

At larger companies, an employee is capped by their learning rate and the willingness for leadership to teach them. At a startup, employees are only capped by their learning rate. This comes as a double-edged sword. On one hand, personal growth as a startup employee is very much a &ldquo;you versus yourself&rdquo; battle. With every employee wearing multiple hats and doing work across different traditional sectors, each has exposure to the majority of the business process and can take ownership in any part of it. On the other hand, mentorship in larger companies is priceless. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;People who&rsquo;ve been around for 10-15 years can teach you things that would have taken you a whole decade to learn.

The seeds were planted while serving as a volunteer for SPARK, a program geared towards helping kids in the area who needed to be re-engaged in their education.

Buildings across the city were damaged, including the LocalAventura travel company headquarters. The setback didn&rsquo;t stop company co-founder Cait Breslin from working on the company&rsquo;s latest ad campaign that would market the company&rsquo;s services towards a new and more targeted demographic of potential customers. Cait and her staff bounced between various locations, sometimes even working past midnight in Cait&rsquo;s apartment. They had a deadline to meet, and after weeks of hard work, Cait and the team launched the <a href=\"https://www.localaventura.com\">LocalAventura</a> campaign on a Friday night filled with anticipation and celebration. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-45a4101c-20ae-eb04-c658-9d350e001380\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">But despite Cait&rsquo;s aura of a seasoned traveler, the Philadelphia native had never been on a plane or gone far outside of Philadelphia until college. Growing up, Cait went to a Ukrainian-Catholic all-girls high school where the principal was a nun from Honduras. She taught one class, AP Spanish Literature - &ldquo;I remember it was me and three other girls with Hermana Carla - I mean, Sister Carla,&rdquo; Cait corrects herself with a laugh. Sister Carla would tell stories about growing up in Honduras and boyfriends she had before she became a nun, fascinating her students with the world of Latin America, a life thousands of miles from home. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Cait&rsquo;s experience with Hermana Carla would lead her to continue exploring the Latin American culture as she began college at the University of Pennsylvania. Though she double majored in both Biological Basis of Behavior and Hispanic Studies, studying Latin American culture was the highlight of her studies. &ldquo;Every time I had a class in Williams Hall for my humanities courses, the professor would walk in with a big smile on their face. Whereas going to organic chemistry lecture- &ldquo; Cait pauses, &ldquo;it was a very different atmosphere.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Then, in her junior year, Cait went to Buenos Aires, Argentina to study abroad, marking the start what would become a life-changing summer. &ldquo;I went tango dancing, drank wine, and it was amazing - I was just living my life and felt completely self-actualized.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Back on Penn&rsquo;s campus, Cait began reflecting on her travels: &ldquo;I was living with a host family, so in that way, I was privileged in that I got to feel like a local and become a part of their family, but I realized a lot of people who come to Latin America don&rsquo;t get to have the kind of experiences I did.&rdquo; &nbsp;Information in the Latin American tourism industry is fragmented with thousands of online reviews scattered across websites that take travelers weeks to sift through. There are passionate, professional, and talented tour guides who speak fluent English and have great experiences to offer to travelers in their countries. Often times, these guides don&rsquo;t have the money to create search-engine-optimized websites or the knowledge to market to foreign clientele. The lucky agencies who could find these tour guides rely on word of mouth recommendations to continue their business, making it difficult to expand to a large volume of customers. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The kindling of an idea for facilitating Latin American travel for others like herself grew into a steady fire, stoked as Cait finished her undergraduate studies. She eventually met her two co-founders at Penn as they were completing their MBAs at Wharton, and together they conceptualized a business that drew upon their passions for travel and Latin American culture.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The result was LocalAventura, a platform where the travelers could be directly connected to a curated collection of tours and tour guides. &ldquo;We decided right from the beginning that we only wanted to offer the best tours and tour guides,&rdquo; Cait further explains, &ldquo;our policy is that we always go on each tour and meet with each guide before we start working with them. Sometimes we&rsquo;ll meet with the people and go on the tour, but it doesn&rsquo;t work out because it&rsquo;s just not a good fit or maybe not up to our standards.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For the guides that Cait and her team select to work with LocalAventura, they work to ensure that the guides become integral parts of both the company and their family. &ldquo;I just had a housewarming party about 2 weeks ago, and a couple of the guides from Mexico City came, so it&rsquo;s really nice. We have meaningful relationships with them because we connect on a mission level of facilitating people coming here, and not just going on a big bus and taking pictures, but really learning about the culture and engaging with it.&rdquo; Cait and her team have not only visited all 10 of the countries in Latin America that LocalAventura operates in, but they also have lived in and become locals in each of these areas, building real relationships with the people there. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">And as LocalAventura began receiving more customers, its mission also began to grow. People began requesting for LocalAventura to help them plan their honeymoons, anniversaries, and family vacations. Cait soon realized that she and the LocalAventura team could leverage their local expertise and these relationships to offer customized trips as its own branch of services. LocalAventura now boasts a duality of travel options. On one side, it is a curated travel platform for customers to book pre-organized tours such as the </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.localaventura.com/tours/meet-the-alpacas-of-chile-t168\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Meet the Alpacas of Chile</span></a><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> tour with little to no assistance, but it also offers expert-guided services for people planning customized trips requiring more insight and personalization. &ldquo;One of the things that we really like is that we can offer a $30 bike tour in Lima, but also plan a $300 luxury, all-inclusive wine tour in Chile. We can cater to all kinds of budgets,&rdquo; Cait explains. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Behind LocalAventura&rsquo;s success and growth is an incredibly high volume and high-intensity workload. &ldquo;Last week I felt like I was working from the minute I got up to the minute I went to sleep because there was just so much to do,&rdquo; Cait admits sheepishly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re also in the middle of fundraising right now, so I&rsquo;m going on tours, I&rsquo;m trying to network, and it&rsquo;s hard to do all of that while also running a business.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">But for Cait, working to facilitate the kind of travel experiences that had shaped her life and passions for others is always rewarded. &ldquo;This Saturday morning, I woke up to a video from one of our guides in Brazil,&rdquo; she recalls fondly, &ldquo;he was giving a tour in S&atilde;o Paulo of the Ba&uacute; Stone, which is a crazy natural skyscraper that you can climb up. In the selfie video he sent, they were at the top and the client was smiling from ear to ear, and I just thought to myself that everything was worth it. It&rsquo;s not a particularly glamorous lifestyle, but the fulfillment that you get from working on something that you love and could someday reach large volumes of people is wonderful and motivating.&rdquo;</span></p>",

Whether it&rsquo;s complex molecular markers or something as simple as your weight changing. There are always indicators that are changing in your body in real time, signaling the onset of disease before your symptoms do.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">He first started grappling with this concept during his senior year of high school.

They need blood tests and follow-ups every 2 weeks, some every few days, to ensure their body has properly stabilized. With each follow-up equating to a trip to the doctor&rsquo;s office, many patients do not comply with the appropriate frequency because of the time and money associated with appointments. This is where InnaMed comes in. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Their product analyzes a small sample of blood for multiple markers and reports the findings to the appropriate providers. This cuts the inefficiency in the transfer and analysis of physiological information between patient and provider significantly, especially for patients who must have their blood tested frequently. The main innovation in their product revolves around the electrochemical and biochemical techniques they use to detect specific molecules in the blood. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;A lot of blood testing comes down to using antibodies to tag markers and measuring some kind of fluorescence read out, but this process is difficult to bring to the patient&rsquo;s home - especially for markers in very low concentrations.&rdquo; Their intellectual property revolves around the electrochemical detection of markers using a different class of molecules called aptamers instead of traditional antibodies.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In the future, they plan to add voice and video capabilities to their device as well.

Talking to the device, they would be able to communicate contextual information to physicians such as shortness of breath, swelling, and pain all in an efficient manner - perhaps even in-person follow-up visits the second or third option for outpatient care.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Though they are still perfecting the product, they&rsquo;ve already gone a long way. It has been a year and a half since the startup materialized. Since then, the team applied to <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/\">Y-Combinator</a>, a highly acclaimed accelerator in San Francisco, went through the program, and came back to Penn to work on InnaMed full-time. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The interview to get into the accelerator seemed grueling. It was a 10 minute interview with rapid fire questions - almost 30. &ldquo;They judge your ability to confidently answer their questions. Your opinions need to be informed, not necessarily a hundred percent correct.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Once they passed the interview and were accepted, Eshwar and his current cofounder, Anup Singh, dropped everything to go to San Francisco - Eshwar took a semester off Penn and Anup a semester off his PhD program at UCLA - to pour their effort into InnaMed. One of his biggest takeaways from the experience was the network.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s people from all walks of life. It&rsquo;s really humbling to see that anyone can come in with an idea, take the risk of following through with that idea, and hope to become successful regardless of their background. Every company that comes through YC has a different story with a path that&rsquo;s completely unique. It just shows that there&rsquo;s no set formula to achieving what you want.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Another positive impact of his experience starting the company off at YC was the focus. For two and a half months, they were dedicated to nothing but their product, with a host of peers, mentors, and past entrepreneurs to guide them. According to Eshwar, YC helps with two things: &ldquo;1: Set milestones and 2: Work your ass off to achieve them.&rdquo; If there&rsquo;s any formula, that seems to be it.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Since coming back to campus, Eshwar says they have grown the team and continued the pace that YC helped set for them. InnaMed is currently working out of lab space in the Science Center.</span> </span></p>",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A driven computer science major and die-hard wrestler at Drexel University, Ethan Keiser struggled to juggle an intense degree and his craft. After long practices, Keiser found his wrestling friends needed outside help on their academics. The situation was not unique to just athletes, as other students also expressed a desire for similar academic support. He realized a need for on-demand tutoring services for students at the university level - a sort of &ldquo;Uber for tutors.&rdquo; But he quickly realized that tutoring services weren&rsquo;t scalable, at least not at the level he wanted to provide them. Seeing an abundance of underutilized university-provided services, he aspired to provide a scalable academic coach that can wire students to resources they need. Keiser and his team then begun to build StudyTree - an AI-driven company that students today literally rely on to shape their academic careers. </span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-b2e65a49-1ffc-0d55-df51-ac170950e77d\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">StudyTree helps students utilize their university&rsquo;s resources. The app enables universities to organize academic support services into a network. Next comes Leon, a virtual academic coach with AI capabilities. Leon uses the network to help students understand what resources they might need. Keiser also provides analytics for universities to see how StudyTree is benefiting their students. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To put these features into concrete terms, consider the following scenario. A student has a paper due at midnight and feels like they are hitting a wall. The student chats with Leon, telling him how the paper isn&rsquo;t going so well. Leon then responds by encouraging the student to go to the university&rsquo;s writing center. What&rsquo;s extremely exciting about Leon is that he has learned, through scouring data regarding grade history and student utilization of campus resources, what tools can benefit students in unique, individual situations. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">StudyTree has taken on a monumental task. Effectively scaling an artificial academic coach to hundreds of thousands of students, across majors, with varying skill levels, is no small task. It takes careful human guidance and a deep understanding of students&rsquo; problems. Utilizing cutting edge AI research and his own experience as a struggling student, Keiser has built Leon into the academic coach he wishes he had. He elaborates on his college years: </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;My best quality was that I was highly introspective - I could see myself make mistakes. In order to build a technology to help students, you really need to understand those students&rsquo; problems.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Keiser has met with extremely gratifying successes, though not without struggles. During his senior year in college, Keiser turned StudyTree into his senior year project with a few team members. He took his team to Microsoft&rsquo;s Managing Cup and won 1st place in the United States. The recognition earned him an investment from one of the world&rsquo;s leading education groups. But in the summer of 2015, dark times hit. Offered more money and security from larger companies, many of Keiser&rsquo;s members left him. The education group lost confidence in Keiser&rsquo;s team and pulled their investment. However, Keiser&rsquo;s grit and stubborn naivete empowered him to push forward. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;At some point you have to be so naive and narcissistic to believe that everyone else is wrong and that this is going to work. I pushed and said, &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about.&rsquo; It comes down to being super-resilient. You need to figure it out quickly when capital is dwindling.

Over the next 2 years, the company hopes to partner with 50 universities, integrate with various learning management systems, and prove that their technology truly improves student retention and graduation rates.

    "route_name": "thomascavett",
    "content": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Once every three minutes someone dies from injury or violence in the US. That&rsquo;s 199,000 people whose lives are cut short from horror stories that not only deal physical trauma to the victims, but impart emotional trauma on their friends and families. It&rsquo;s easy for us to forget something so terrible because it&rsquo;s just a statistic, an unemotional number foreign to our everyday lives. For Thomas Cavett, trauma is something intimately familiar to him that he has never forgotten. After six years as a Special Forces Medical Sergeant, Cavett has seen it all. From pulling teeth to amputating limbs, Cavett has trained to provide emergency medical care at any moment, for any injury, in any environment. After performing hundreds of procedures on fellow soldiers and foreign civilians, Cavett has both been able to save lives and have to watch them fade away because he was not able to reach the victim fast enough. Now, after transitioning from active duty as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces_(United_States_Army)\">Green Beret</a>, Cavett is focused on ensuring that patients get the rapid emergency medical care they need with his Point of Wounding Trauma Indicator, a high-tech wearable that can detect when the user has suffered a traumatic injury and immediately signals emergency medical responders to the scene by transmitting information to 911 dispatch systems. Today he is CEO of <a href=\"https://powti.com/\">POWTI</a> Innovations, but his desire to help others started long before now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Cavett was born to serve. Growing up in Jackson, Mississippi, he dreamed of being a fighter pilot. His parents had both served in the military, retiring right before he was born, and so he &ldquo;grew up hearing stories about [their service] all the time.&rdquo; His parents not only inspired Cavett to serve his country, but to help others in any way he could. His father&rsquo;s job as a physician piqued his interest in medicine, prompting Cavett to work as an EMT in college. However, instead of studying biology or nursing, Cavett actually majored in international affairs and Japanese at George Washington University. The interest in international affairs came from Cavett&rsquo;s passion for learning about foreign cultures, and the study in Japanese stemmed from spending his sophomore year of high school living in Japan and falling in love with the nation and its people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Before coming to Japan, Cavett ran cross-country in middle school and high school, during which time he made friends with Japanese exchange students who became his running partners on the team. Cavett was fascinated about their stories from back home and wanted to experience completely immersing himself in another language and culture. His parents were expectedly skeptical of the idea, but as Cavett describes the situation, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pretty headstrong committed person, so I told them that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do and they went for it.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While he knew he wanted to serve in the military while applying to college, it was not until his junior year of college that he decided he wanted to become a Green Beret. The role combined everything Cavett loved. He would be serving his country, treating patients, travelling abroad, speaking another language, operating outdoors, and living a high-octane adventure. Instead of focusing on the dangers and risk involved, Cavett describes the role of a Green Beret as, &ldquo;You get to be outdoors doing exciting things, jumping out of planes, blowing things up, and you get paid for it.&rdquo; With that enthusiasm it&rsquo;s hard to see why he left, but with a wife and two kids Cavett realized that he could not bear to spend his entire life away from his family, deployed two thirds of the year. He and his team could be operating anywhere in South East Asia while his family waited at home in Okinawa, not knowing whether or not he was safe. Once he decided to explore his interest in business, Cavett was determined on getting into the best business school in the country.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"I was actually studying for the GMAT while I was deployed.

[It] makes you very risk-tolerant, you get very comfortable in ambiguous environments [with] not a lot of structure or guidance because you&rsquo;re trained to be able to be dropped in some country, potentially by yourself or with one or two people, and you&rsquo;re expected to perform and execute without being able to call back and be like &ldquo;Hey what should I do?&rdquo; </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">That gave me a lot of confidence and ability to figure out a plan on my own without working within a very structured environment</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Coming back to civilian life, however, Cavett thankfully has not had to figure out everything on his own as he found a strong veteran community here, which is what initially attracted him to Wharton, and has made countless other friends. For Cavett the hardest part of the transition to civilian life was leaving his team whom he had deployed with countless times. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through good and bad experiences together...And it&rsquo;s just an environment where everybody knows each other so well that you almost don&rsquo;t have to talk to communicate.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, coming to Philadelphia began the start of another adventure for Cavett as he began to meet new people from all over the world, who all had unique stories of their own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When Cavett was first accepted to Wharton he began talking with his co-founder, Frank Miller, about the initial idea that has grown into POWTI Innovations. Miller was an adjunct professor of Cavett&rsquo;s back at GWU who taught a class on emergency tactical medicine as he was a former special operations medic for the Navy. The two men have seen &ldquo;a lot of trauma throughout [their] careers in the military, also as civilian medical providers,&rdquo; which influenced the story behind POWTI. However, the primary influence for POWTI was the story of one of Miller&rsquo;s fellow firefighters who fell off an elevated highway while putting out a vehicle fire. His fellow firefighters were so busy putting out the fire, that nobody noticed he was missing until hours later. Once they found him the man was already dead. For Cavett and Miller this is unacceptable; first responders who spend their lives keeping the public safe, should not have to worry about whether they are going to make it home at the end of the day. The saddest part of the story is that if someone had known the firefighter was injured, he could have been helped in time, and his passing would have been prevented. </span></p>\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The fact is that studies show that almost forty percent of [trauma-related fatalities] are preventable because the truth is that trauma is actually pretty easy to treat. It&rsquo;s not like treating diseases where there is a lot of variability...the treatments themselves are relatively simple. The key variable is the time. So from that injury point to receiving that definitive care is the single most important variable to determining your outcome.</span></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">What the Point of Wounding Trauma Indicator does is detect when the wearer has suffered a traumatic injury, and then alert rescue personnel by sharing the location of the user. Additionally the team is working on delivering information to medical personnel regarding the type of trauma, so that they know what to expect when arriving on the scene. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">POWTI uses a variety of sensors to detect trauma. A fall such as what the firefighter suffered, or the impact of an object hitting your body, causes a large acceleration not found in normal circumstances. That sudden spike in acceleration triggers the device. The overpressure from a concussive explosion will cause a spike in atmospheric pressure triggering the device. The user catching on fire would cause a spike in temperature, triggering the device. Running behind all these sensors is software that can sort through any noise in the data and determine whether or not there has been a traumatic injury. While POWTI can detect the vast majority of traumatic events, if the device does not trigger an alert, because a distant part of the body distant from center mass where POWTI is located is somehow affected, the user can manually trigger the device similar to using Life Alert. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When he arrived at Wharton, Cavett was considering other, more traditional, career paths such as management consulting, but that all changed when he went to a Lauder pitch competition in New York City and won, beating fellow students and alumni going all the way back to the 1980&rsquo;s who had far more business experience than him. That served as validation for the idea behind POWTI and he has since dived into entrepreneurship head first. Besides solving a pressing need for police officers, firefighters, and soldiers, POWTI also is invaluable to industries such as construction and oil and gas which have the highest rates of traumatic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap; text-indent: 36pt;\">The system is easy to sell and easy to scale because it can easily patch into municipal dispatch systems which use common software. In terms of sales, POWTI plans to begin pilot programs with five police departments and fire departments in early 2018, and is targeting individual buyers as well by tapping into veteran communities who love to buy new gear, especially anything safety related. Since POWTI Innovations is not treating or diagnosing disease, they do not have to go through FDA approval which shortens the timeline to when they can hit market and begin to help save people&rsquo;s lives. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When asked what he would say to any students who are thinking about starting companies, Cavett gave the following advice:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">My litmus test for doing a startup... is that...I eat sleep and breathe nothing but this business honestly. It keeps me up at night; I&rsquo;m fiercely passionate about the mission...And so I think that it has to be something that you have that passion for and you&rsquo;re so sure about that you&rsquo;re rock solid in your commitment because the part of entrepreneurship...is that it&rsquo;s an emotional roller coaster and you have super highs where you raise a round, or you win a contest, or sell your first customer, and you have other days where you get told no, or something doesn&rsquo;t work in your product development and you have to pivot, and it&rsquo;s like you put your whole life into that&hellip; and you have to be ready to weather those moments. </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Thomas Cavett&rsquo;s passion for helping others and saving lives has already led him to make a difference in the world through his deployment in the Army Special Forces, and now he and his co-founder will continue to save lives through POWTI Innovations.</span> </span></p>",

You quickly call 911, give them your approximate location and proximity to the fire. Soon, firefighters from the nearest fire department are notified of the location of the fire and travel to the scene. Once there, they spend time trying to assess what direction the fire is spreading, the whereabouts of trapped individuals, and necessary strategies for eliminating the fire as soon as possible. In addition to the pressure of time, they have to deal with reduced visibility, the vague coordinates provided to them, and their own safety. This process takes around 2-3 minutes, while a fire can take less than 1 minute to double in size. By the time the firefighters reach you and your family, it may be too late.</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-3bfca0b2-2002-2b0d-eaf2-c2b62a0011ba\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Trevor Pennypacker, a sophomore at Penn studying Physics and Computer Engineering, envisions a different scenario. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;When the fire department receives a call, they push a button, which sends out one of our drones which flies autonomously to the scene of the fire. The first thing it does is it provides exact GPS coordinates of the fire. Once the firefighters are on their way, they can open up their phones or tablets and view a live 360 view of the fire so they can start to analyze the situation before they get there.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Using this method, Trevor and his friends, Divyadita Shrivastava and Aditya Sriram, hope to allow firefighters to be more effective in their endeavours by minimizing the time spent between a fire notification and active assistance. Their company, Paladin Drones, develops a software platform for drones that allows for live, multi-device video streaming, accurate GPS reporting, and autonomous flight. In addition, their software uses thermal imaging analysis to identify and distinguish between fires, people, and other objects of interest. The potential benefit that this software platform provides is enormous. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">First, accurate GPS reporting significantly reduces time spent searching for the best angle of attack. &nbsp;&ldquo;Over 70% of provided GPS coordinates reported to fire departments are inaccurate. Our drone would go to the area that firefighters may go initially, scan the area, and then report the actual location of the fire.&rdquo; Furthermore, live video streaming to multiple devices means that firefighters from different locations all have real-time views of the scene from the time the drone takes off to the time the fire is extinguished. Pairing these two features with thermal imaging analysis, firefighters can save precious time by not mistaking hot, inanimate objects with humans. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;For search and rescue missions, firefighters call in a helicopter that takes 30 minutes to an hour to arrive. A firefighter gets on with a really low quality thermal camera that costs $8000 and they just look through it. They&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Oh there&rsquo;s a person!&rsquo;, and they&rsquo;ll jump down only to find out it's a rock that's been sitting out in the sun for a while. Hopefully our thermal image recognition algorithms will prevent these scenarios from occurring.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Paladin Drones hopes to sell their drones at a cost well below other fire surveying drones, which may cost upwards of $70,000 due to expensive thermal cameras (without image recognition capabilities) and fire-proof drone bodies due to a lack of autonomous flight. Several fire departments have expressed interest in Paladin Drones' product in the form of LOIs (Letters of Intent). One fire department chief even stated that he would be willing to spend their full annual budget on Paladin Drones&rsquo; product.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The inspiration behind Paladin Drones originates from an unlikely source: Trevor&rsquo;s peanut allergy. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;When I was little, my parents found out I had a peanut allergy. My parents were unsure how to raise someone with a peanut allergy because neither of them had ever had peanut allergies. It turned out that the fire chief in my town had a severe peanut allergy, and he kind of took me on when I was little and as a big mentor when I was growing up. When I was older, I realized how far behind the technology that fire departments were using was. They were using crappy, expensive thermal cameras and Windows Vista.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Trevor, Divyadita, and Aditya knew they had to do something. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair. It&rsquo;s not right that these people are going out and risking their lives but don&rsquo;t even have access to the right technology.&rdquo; Their vision has becoming more and more of a reality each day.

We have faced a lot of challenges along the way including doubting our own abilities. One night last Spring when we were still throwing ideas around, Aditya and I came to the conclusion that there was absolutely no way we were going to do anything. We didn&rsquo;t have the technical knowledge to build a product like this, we didn&rsquo;t know anything about business, and we were just buffooning around.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, when they brought up these concerns with Divyadita, he wouldn&rsquo;t take no for an answer. &ldquo;Divy took it upon his shoulders to grind out a part of our software platform. In a month, we had a drone that could autonomously lift off, fly to a specified location, circle around a building, and land. After this, we all started investing a lot of time to fully realize our vision.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While Paladin Drones still has a long way to go, Trevor already has a list of plans for the future of the company.

Among these different research directions, the analysis of networks and complex systems stood out. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m fascinated by problems that look complex from the outside, but you can get a very simple intuition about how they work.

You can really tell they&rsquo;re different. One cluster has a starlike structure, one has a closed, cluster-like structure. In the cluster-like structure, information will be more densely passed among the individual units. In the starlike structure, information will be passed from these &lsquo;collector-like&rsquo; nodes to the center of the star. So the way in which these two parts of the system work and interact with each other depends on the makeup of their individual connections.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, while graph theory may help specify these individual theories, it is still possible that the intricacies of complex networks in the brain may be over-simplified. Theoretical models always make assumptions, which can run the risk of obscuring reality. But for now, Bassett&rsquo;s research has remained undisturbed by these assumptions. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;One of the interesting questions that needs to be asked, is: how far will a simple model take you? It turns out that in my field of research, you can actually get very far in gaining useful intuitions from understanding these simpler patterns of conductivity while ignoring where things sit in the brain, what types of neurons are here, or what types of neurotransmitters are packed there. It&rsquo;s surprising, but I think that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so exciting.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Bassett&rsquo;s research has led to a better understanding of a plethora of phenomenon. One such phenomenon relates to how behavior and cognitive abilities in humans change throughout the aging process. Results from Bassett&rsquo;s research suggest that that the more modular the structure of an individual's neuronal networks, the easier it is for that individual to learn. In other words, it&rsquo;s beneficial for your brain to consist of several smaller, densely packed &lsquo;cities,&rsquo; each connected to each other by a single path. Contrast this structure with one large city, containing lots of entangled paths to between its small subcomponents.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;When two parts of a system are separate, it allows each part of the system to...change independently of other parts.

He recalls how his family would talk about people working in the Peace Corps:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"They almost sounded heroic to me as a kid&mdash;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">someone who has gone to work in a country they may have never seen, learning a language they&rsquo;ve never spoken, in order to serve somewhere far from home for two years,&rdquo; David recalls. What gave David the push he needed to join finally came through a meeting with a college counselor who said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a window in life that is closing. You can&rsquo;t see it or hear it, but it is- you have a chance now so take it.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">After graduating from Yale, David began teaching English as a Peace Corps volunteer in Fuling, a small industrial city in the Chongqing province of Western China. Traveling across the world to live and work came with its fair share of realizations.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt more American than when I was in China. You realize how many things you&rsquo;ve taken for granted and how many assumptions you&rsquo;ve carried with you about how the world works that are not necessarily shared.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yet despite the vastly different cultural backgrounds of David and the people of Fuling, he found himself welcomed into the community and given the opportunity to form unexpectedly deep friendships.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">There are fewer places further from David&rsquo;s hometown of Haverford, Pennsylvania than Fuling, China. But for David, &ldquo;to have gone to a place that was so unknown and so foreign and still be able to make friends and develop meaningful relations&mdash;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">it shows you something fundamentally optimistic about the world and humanity.&rdquo; David returned to the United States with a reframed perspective. &ldquo;I think that China was never nearly as far away as I had always thought,&rdquo; he reflects. He knew he wanted to continue the trajectory of work that he had done in the Peace Corps, something that involved working in service that would take him across cultural and lingual divides.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">His next steps would take him to Harvard Law School and then to a prestigious law firm in New York City. But even as David practiced law, he was still thinking about ways to employ his cross-cultural experiences from the Peace Corps. The product that emerged would become known as Tea Leaf Nation&mdash;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">a publication created by David and two fellow Harvard graduates. The newborn publication was shaped by how, at the time, Western media was scrutinizing the Chinese government&rsquo;s manipulation and censorship of web-based content. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tea Leaf Nation was a direct application of David&rsquo;s ideas and realizations during his time in Fuling. Chinese social media and news information was technically accessible by anyone in a Western country. But when they were conveyed through Western reporting, they might be distorted by cultural and linguistic differences. To properly convey the thoughts of the billion people in China&mdash;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">people that Western media outlets often portrayed as a faceless mass effect of the Chinese government&rsquo;s actions&mdash;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">David and his team would sift through real Chinese social media sites for any sort of content that shone a new light on the Chinese grassroots dialogue and its differences between the Chinese government&rsquo;s and Western media&rsquo;s portrayals. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">Tea Leaf Nation soon grew to the point where it began catching the attention of major news outlets in America. Eventually, David sold the business to the Washington Post Company, which retained him as Senior Editor to manage Tea Leaf Nation as one of Foreign Policy magazine&rsquo;s new online channels, where it currently thrives as a major source of news covering China. Since then, David has written about and presented on China in a multitude of publications and public stages. His current work as an Entrepreneur In Residence at the Lenfest Institute for Journalism is to bring underrepresented voices into the media conversation. Throughout all his endeavors, Wertime carries with him the lessons he learned overseas.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I think being in the Peace Corps really developed the instinct to reach beyond my immediate lens and my comfort zone, and it showed me that doing so is not only not as scary as you might think, but can also be incredibly fun and rewarding.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;\">But even as David&rsquo;s work expands, one his most rewarding moments as an entrepreneur was in the early days of Tea Leaf Nation. For the fledgling startup&rsquo;s first &lsquo;birthday,&rsquo; David&rsquo;s wife threw a surprise party and invited the team&rsquo;s writers, some of whom Skyped in from around the world.

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Like many professors, Jean Gallier was never initially drawn to computer science. Coming into a technical college, he was registered as a civil engineering student. What sparked his interest was his frustration with the compilers he was using. In computer science, compilers are in charge of processing human-readable code into machine-readable code. Now, it takes no more than the push of a button. Back when Gallier was in college, it involved assembling a deck of ordered cards and feeding them into a physical compiler, which would take several minutes. The mystery of compilers fascinated Gallier and helped define his interest in computer science for the rest of his life. </span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-88665b33-6d95-810f-4d90-055c8132954f\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At the end of Gallier&rsquo;s second year in the French university system, he found out about a program for technically-inclined students to complete a Master&rsquo;s degree in the US. He figured he fit the description, so he followed his passion to UCLA. &ldquo;Plus, I wasn&rsquo;t in a big hurry to do my military service. This was a good way to postpone that.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At UCLA, he quickly got involved with automata theory and decidability, as well as programming in a language called PL1. After taking the programming course, Gallier became a TA for it, teaching it for the next two quarters. He also met the woman who he would later marry, just as his degree was nearing completion. The normal course of action was to return to France after getting his degree, but she wasn&rsquo;t as eager to go. His professor at the time also offered up another path.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;You seem interested,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you apply for the PhD? You already have a masters, you just keep going. We have money for you for at least the first year.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">His advisor was Leonard Kleinrock. Kleinrock was an expert in the specialized field of queueing theory, as well as one of the founders of the internet. After Gallier took his initial courses in queueing theory, he found the probability theory aspect of the material &ldquo;unexciting.&rdquo; Luckily, he quickly stumbled upon a new path.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Completely by coincidence, I see some notes on a friends desk and I look at it and it was something very mysterious. With lots of Greek letters, languages, automata, all kinds of that stuff. I said &lsquo;What is this? Who teaches this?&rsquo; and the guy says, &lsquo;Sheila Greibach.&rsquo; So I took one of her courses. Woah that was hard. But it was beautiful. I decided I had to drop queueing theory and do something with Sheila.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sheila Greibach was interested in the fields of formal verification and program correctness. As a first assignment, she handed Gallier a dissertation by Leslie Valiant, a prominent computer scientist at the time.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;His dissertation was a masterpiece. Coming as a fresh student, I couldn&rsquo;t do anything better than what he had done. She wanted for me to improve certain aspects and I banged my head for a year and I still remember coming to her and telling her I wasn&rsquo;t able to do this. She looked at it and she said &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">His interest in formal verification led him from completing his PhD at UCLA to conducting research at Penn in the same field.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;The idea [behind formal verification] is that when people write programs, you should be able to tell if they do what they&rsquo;re supposed to do. These are usually some kind of inductive techniques, but it&rsquo;s extremely painful to do that manually. The hope was that you could automate the process. You&rsquo;d have to come up with what&rsquo;s called automated theorem provers. The complexity is very high, so it&rsquo;s very hard to do practically, so people moved more to program checking rather than actual verification. The two are sort of related.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">And so began the evolution of Gallier&rsquo;s interests. For a few years before he took his sabbatical, he dove deep into improving compilers, which was also tangentially related to program checking.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Gallier used his sabbatical as an opportunity to go back to France and work as a researcher at the Digital Equipment Corporation lab in Paris. During the time he was there, he worked alongside many famous computer scientists, including Turing Award winner, Leslie Lamport. &ldquo;I was hoping to work there afterwards,&rdquo; he confessed, but the company folded before he could return.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When he came back to Penn, he made good friends with Noam Badler, who taught a computer graphics course at the time. He convinced Gallier to teach a course on the mathematical machinery behind geometric design and splines, a &ldquo;scary&rdquo; new territory for him. It was through the courses Gallier was teaching that he met Ken Shoemake.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;He was kind of slightly odd, very bright person and he took the graduate version of 262. He was kind of eccentric, he always had solutions that were kind of right but not quite right. He came, he fought me, I showed him it was wrong. He claimed it was right. He came to me laughing saying &lsquo;You&rsquo;re gonna do that? You&rsquo;re crazy!

Later, Shoemake made a name for himself in computer graphics. He introduced quaternions as a computational tool to deal with rotations on screens, and his work is used regularly in movies and games alike. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">On the winding path of his career</span><span style=\"color: #545454; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&mdash;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">from automata to compilers, from formal verification to graphics, Gallier found it beneficial to write books. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re comprehensive documents that cover the area thoroughly.

Finding a publisher for the book was proving to be difficult, though. He faced rejection from several major publishers until a man named Brian Barsky took a look at the draft. Barsky was involved in computer graphics applications and medical imaging. He also sat on the board of Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, which specialized in engineering and computer science books. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Since then, Gallier has published five books, with a couple more manuscripts in the works.

He earned his undergraduate degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Chemical Engineering, where he was also on the swimming team. Zhou jokes that as an engineering student he survived on Panda Express, a combination of fast food and real vegetables. After his undergraduate years, Zhou started working for Boston Consulting Company (BCC). Since BCC sponsors its employees to get their MBA, Zhou ended up applying to Wharton. Zhou was attracted to Wharton&rsquo;s MBA program because of the quantitative nature of the school. </span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-7d567e17-3c9a-fa97-4bb7-7dc50cd9df73\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Before Jeff Zhou first semester of their Wharton MBA in August of 2014 he met his future co-founder, John Li, at PennApps, the quintessential place to form a partnership. During that weekend they worked on a mini game together and cemented their partnership. Once the Fall semester began they worked on numerous projects together. That very semester an idea for Figloans was hatched. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"Essentially it's a startup that focuses on using heterogeneity and mission alignment to provide socially responsible financial products for underbanked borrowers.&rdquo; Zhou was inspired after taking a course taught by Peter Schrader. The course stressed the importance of heterogeneity. The second part of inspiration for FigLoans came from Zhou&rsquo;s desire to achieve financial equality. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;The idea that credit scores today run 700-720-750. 350-600 is &lsquo;unlendable&rsquo;&hellip; the premise that all of these people can't be the same.

As a college student you probably got your driver&rsquo;s license around age fifteen or sixteen. Now you probably look different than that picture. But what if everyone treated you like that photo was representative of how you look now? People with credit scores may have had issues with credit from the past, but that is not representative of their present or future. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">On March 18, 2015 Zhou and Li flew to Houston on a 5 AM flight to present to nonprofits about FigLoans. They had been in contact with United Way, and for Zhou this was a defining moment. FigLoans received positive feedback from the 100 people in the room. The nonprofits essentially told Zhou and Li if you can build this, we need it. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Fast forward to right after their graduation in May 2015, Zhou and Li moved to Houston into a single bedroom to launch and fund FigLoans. Zhou said one of the biggest sacrifices of being an entrepreneur is &ldquo;when you graduate we moved to Houston and shared a single bedroom and all of our friends took jobs in finance and consulting and started doing cool things like traveling and you just don't have that kind of time, and you're almost in a race against the clock.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Despite the sacrifices made by the founders, FigLoans is continuing to grow and serve its customer base. When people are in a tough financial spot, they can go to nonprofits who have a financial coach. FigLoans is now an option to help finance their pressing expenses. The ideal situation is that a nonprofit can provide grant-funded products for FigLoans. Zhou says that even if the nonprofit cannot recommend FigLoans or cannot otherwise help finance a customer, FigLoans always tells nonprofits to advise against taking out a Payday loan or Title loan because they are quite predatory, especially out in Texas. In the example of a Title loan a person signs their car to pay for the loan, and if the person can&rsquo;t pay back their loan their car is taken away. The interest rate for these loans are about 300%. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While most startups face challenges with the efficacy of marketing, FigLoans had early success. Zhou states that, &ldquo;We ended up picking the right problem and it ended up being really helpful for getting our name out.&rdquo; The product was truly needed by people, therefore as soon as it was available, people would use it. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Zhou&rsquo;s advice to new entrepreneurs is, &ldquo;First is to be very judicious in picking the problem you are trying to solve.\" He encourages current students to think outside of problems central to college students, because most of these problems aren&rsquo;t necessarily pressing needs. Zhou also advises, &ldquo;Don't forget to have fun. A lot of people get caught up in trying to make it work and trying to succeed that they forget to enjoy the little things.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Looking toward the future, Zhou envisions FigLoans as a bridge. &ldquo;I want us to be the best bridge possible for people who have made a credit mistake in the past, and so they can use Fig and regain access to things like credit cards and eventually buy a home, buy a car, do things that make up the American dream so to speak. Be able to do that and for everyone to look at them for the person they are.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\">Now FigLoans is composed of five employees. On a final note, Zhou says, &ldquo;If people are interested in financial equality, we are always very interested in Penn grads and we are hoping to hire three more people this year. As seniors, juniors, sophomores, and freshman are looking for internships or jobs we are happy to have you.&rdquo;</span> </span></p>",

Steigman is a master of pattern recognition, a skill that has served him well from being #1 in the U.S. for chess to building and exiting several startups from entirely different industries. Now, he's at it again with his new real estate startup - <a href=\"http://steignet.com/\">Steignet</a>. </span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-756e2b18-3c9e-e339-d955-9db654374641\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Before cutting into his story as an entrepreneur, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to motivate his goals and mindset with his journey through chess, health, and industry. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Steigman was an international chess champion in his youth. He beat Bobby Fischer&rsquo;s record for becoming a Master at the age of 13, and held the #1 rank in the United States for his age for 8 years in a row until the age of 16. &nbsp;Everything came easily to him, and then things went awry. In a fluke accident, he got bitten by a bug and contracted a combination of Lyme Disease, Meningitis, and Encephalitis, leaving this champion fighting for his life. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;A bunch of the top doctors basically told my parents that I&rsquo;m either going to die or be mentally challenged. I had no short term memory. I couldn&rsquo;t walk. I couldn&rsquo;t talk. I&rsquo;m a big a fighter though... in chess and in life&hellip; and I proved those doctors wrong.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A.J. described how he felt he had to reprogram his own mind to re-learn to do things he had taken for granted. Soon enough, he was back on his feet, regained his #1 ranking, and even won the U.S. Junior Open. Throughout his struggle with health and chess, Steigman developed a sort of mental resilience that definitely shines through his later ventures.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Steigman earned his undergraduate degree in business at Emory University&rsquo;s Goizeuta Business School, and then went to work at Merrill Lynch&rsquo;s Energy and Power group in New York. During his time at the Investment Bank, the financial crisis of 2008 left his team broken. The Energy and Power group took beatings as oil prices everywhere collapsed. To top it off, Bank of America was acquiring Merrill Lynch almost exclusively for it&rsquo;s wealth management sector, and did not care about its Investment Banking divisions. Needless to say, Steigman saw the worst of corporate America. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;The recession brought out a lot of nasty components of human behavior that left a negative impression of the corporate world on my mind. I felt like I could create more value for society if I could take life into my own hands, and just build my own stuff. </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Thus, Steigman propelled himself towards entrepreneurship. He motivated his next venture, a massive streetwear store in Florida, with observations he had made about successful retail ventures after the recession. The store was one of the top Nike accounts in the country and was located at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in South Florida. Everyday, he would be pitched by local designers to get their products in his store. &nbsp;Limited by his square footage, he decided there was more opportunity to sell his interest in the store and found a VC backed e-commerce platform known today as Soletron. Here, Steigman&rsquo;s passion and dedication to his company became truly apparent - for several years, he refused to pay himself any salary in order to build the best product possible, to be motivated, and to stay hungry. On limited resources, Soletron grew to the top .3% of all websites worldwide on traffic. Yet, it was unable to compete on search engines with the industry&rsquo;s largest player that had raised over $500M. &nbsp;Soletron pivoted to content-publishing, and pushed out hundreds of articles and videos every day to its millions of followers and users. Soletron became a content machine and ended up generating over 40,000 unique articles. It were these content production capabilities that motivated the industry leader and Soletron&rsquo;s largest competitor, Karmaloop, to acquire Soletron and to merge their content platforms.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">With Soletron&rsquo;s exit to Karmaloop, A.J. exited the retail world and started seeking his next venture. Again, he applied his knack for pattern matching - but this time to trends in the residential real estate market. He begun to purchase condos and put them up for rent. Frustrated with real estate agents and the lack of financial analysis, he became his own agent by obtaining a real estate license. Then, he saw even more inefficiencies in the residential sector. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Wanting to capitalize on these inefficiencies, Steigman created the idea for Steignet, an arbitrage platform for the residential single-family housing market. In layman&rsquo;s terms, this company uses machine learning, the epitome of applied pattern matching, to detect anomalies in housing prices for clients, ranging from private equity firms to high net-worth individuals or family offices, to invest in these housing units. Steignet&rsquo;s technology aspires to see real-time mispricings. With several potential clients, sourced databases, and developing technologies, Steignet is in its early stages and growing quickly. Within the next few years, Steigman holds to his ambitious goal of growing this company into the world&rsquo;s first quantitative investment firm for the single-family housing market. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Steigman is currently incubating his company at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, where he&rsquo;s pursuing his MBA. Steignet was just accepted into VIPX, UPenn&rsquo;s most selective startup accelerator program, which selects only 5 companies per semester. &nbsp;A laser-focused individual, Steigman is appreciative of the company&rsquo;s recent success and is enjoying the wealth of resources that the university has to offer for entrepreneurs.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Every ingredient you need to be successful is at this place.

Hua Wang, CEO, is focused on making cancer treatment more accessible and affordable. Ideally, newly diagnosed patients should be able to find the exact treatment path for them and a second, professional opinion on clinical trials. &ldquo;It gives them peace of mind,&rdquo; Wang explains. &ldquo;Many patients just want confirmation that they have cancer at this stage and this is the right treatment path.&rdquo; According to The Journal of Clinical Oncology, up to 44% of cancer diagnoses and treatment plans are incorrect, which could have devastating consequences on the patient. SmartBridge offers a tool to make navigating the daunting world of cancer research a little bit easier.</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-9f31c9c2-3ca3-d7eb-7ae2-59f93d707b6f\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The road to SmartBridge was not straightforward. Wang got her first taste of the world of entrepreneurship during her time as a law student. She was taking an energy class with engineering, business, and law students from Northwestern University. The project they were given was focused on creating a solution to increase engagement between the younger generation and a clean energy group, ComEd. Her group&rsquo;s solution was to create an online game that works with a smart meter, thus gamifying electricity consumption. &ldquo;The problem with doing a project in school is that half the team graduated and had jobs.&rdquo; The startup ended early. &ldquo;I did learn one thing though. I love startups.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After a few years working as a lawyer she found herself &ldquo;stressed and bored.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when start-ups called back to her - when SmartBridge was made. After working with a couple friends, the team had created somewhat of a working prototype of their service, enough to earn a grant to work on it further in Chile, South America. She quickly quit her job as a lawyer and hasn&rsquo;t gone back since. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;The grant was specifically for female founders, very early stage,&rdquo; and they fit the bill. They spent those three months further developing their idea, after which they were selected for Rockstart, the number one accelerator in the Netherlands to help launch themselves further into the field. That&rsquo;s when they hit their first pivot. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Our original idea was an on-demand physician consulting service where physicians could do micro-consulting projects for companies. After that accelerator we really pivoted with the rationale \\ that there wasn&rsquo;t really a demand for what we were offering. People either had access to top doctors or didn&rsquo;t want to pay for it.&rdquo; Thanks to their advisors at the Dutch accelerator, they were able to identify two major focuses. This first was a specific market segment, the patients and caregivers, and second a specific disease, cancer.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The team started working towards their refocused goals by finding top flight doctors. &ldquo;We really believe in doctors that are at leading academic research institutions. They have the greatest expertise and the most up to date research and latest figures and clinical trials.&rdquo; When asked about building an app or other technology, Wang said no. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many medical apps. We made a website just so people know who we are, but we realized early on that we are not focused on technology at this early stage.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Their non-tech solution ended up working fine, with a current cohort of 75 doctors from 20 countries across the world. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, though. &ldquo;We were turned down a lot. A lot of doctors kept saying, &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a great idea but I don&rsquo;t have time for it.&rsquo;, or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not being paid enough.&rsquo; But I think we have found a special segment of doctors who want to create a global impact.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img style=\"float: right; padding-top: 15px; margin: 15px;\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/penntechreview-com/image/upload/v1521605566/mar18y2018/hua2.jpg\" width=\"208\" height=\"309\" /></span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">With these doctors, SmartBridge has made a reliable network of cancer treatment professionals through which they guide their customers. They claim that the accessibility they offer is unparalleled. Typically, patients in remote areas are only able to access their local doctors, who are usually general oncologists, not specialized in their individuals&rsquo; specific type of cancer. Then, for people in the later stages of their cancer, there&rsquo;s clinical trials. &ldquo;Their bodies have not responded well to traditional forms of chemotherapy, and they are willing to take an experimental drug or treatment that could save their life, but it&rsquo;s usually not FDA approved. It&rsquo;s more important for them to be in the right trial.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Currently, matching patients with the right clinical trials can take up to four hours of sifting through medical records and analyzing doctors responses to finally give an expert opinion on each specific case. Wang realizes that they need to do better if they are to scale. Enter AI. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We want to incorporate AI to help scale to millions of customers while making sure that a doctor will look at every person and caregiver individually. Right now when we look at medical records, we have about a hundred pages of records. We would have a more junior physician summarize notes into a two page summary. We think that could be replaced by AI. The AI could do the initial summary and an algorithm could then match patients with the right specialist in the platform.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Additionally, Wang intends to make SmartBridge Health the hub for cancer patient clinical data. &ldquo;Right now, most of the cancer data is coming from hospitals and clinical trials. So that&rsquo;s just a tiny segment since only about 3-5% of patients engage in clinical trials. There&rsquo;s really no place right now globally that has patients&rsquo; recorded outcomes.&rdquo; Wang believes her company can become that hub of data for cancer research and trials. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It&rsquo;s the mystery of &ldquo;building something out of nothing&rdquo; that keeps drawing Wang back to entrepreneurship, but she still occasionally gets bogged down by the intricacies of running the business. She claims it&rsquo;s her customers that keep her going. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one woman, a stage 4 cancer patient, and her doctor in New York gave her 85 clinical trials to read through to take. She was at the verge of a nervous breakdown. With our specialist from Duke, we narrowed it down to five trials and now she&rsquo;s in the trial today and has improved health outcomes. That kind of joy from our customers really makes me believe that &lsquo;Yes, we are helping people and are offering something really valuable that the world needs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>",

    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Gabriel Elsner has always loved cars. As a little kid growing up in California, he loved to go to the Los Angeles Auto Show with his grandparents. Gabe would dip and dash between the cars, hopping into every single vehicle. Not just the Ferraris, and Lamborghinis, not just the Mercedes, and BMW, but every SUV, minivan, and hatchback too. Thus, it&rsquo;s no surprise that Elsner&rsquo;s startup ZEV is built to help car dealerships sell more vehicles. But ZEV is about more than just selling cars; the software as a service (SaaS) platform helps dealerships sell electric cars and other zero-emission vehicles. This is because ever since he was my age, Elsner has spent every single day fighting for climate change.</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ed16a33-3ca6-6685-8597-cf91bac577ed\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Elsner always considered himself an adventurer, but he never realized how one trip would change his life forever. In his sophomore year of college, Elsner travelled down to Central America where he saw a place slowly being corroded by the effects of resource scarcity and climate change. Clean water was hard to find, and people barely had enough food to put on their plates as ecosystems were being upturned by environmental degradation. Thus, in the summer of 2006, Elsner decided it was time that he join a growing movement focused on fixing climate change, so that people around the world would not question whether they could access the basic resources necessary to take care of their families. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When Elsner returned to college worked with the Energy Action Coalition on &ldquo;mobilizing thousands of young people across the country to take action on climate change and pressure members of Congress to do something.&rdquo; As part of the same effort, he helped organize Power Shift 2008, &ldquo;the first ever national youth climate conference in Washington D.C.&rdquo; The goal of Power Shift was to pressure members of Congress to pass climate legislation, and brought together six thousand young people across all fifty states. The experience inspired Elsner to work in grassroots activism, and so his &ldquo;first job out of college was working with a broad coalition&hellip;[that was] part of a massive national national campaign to pass a climate bill called Clean Energy Works.&rdquo; The bill was structured to provide private enterprise incentives to adopt cleaner technology, and phase in regulations (such as limitations on carbon emissions) over several years to avoid disrupting industries. The bill would go on to pass through the House of Representatives, but eventually failed in the Senate. Elsner was dismayed by politics at the federal level, and refocused his efforts on the state level.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Over in California, a battle was ensuing over a referendum measure called Proposition 23 (Prop 23). The goal of Prop 23 was to suspend the </span><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Global Warming Act of 2006, a climate law that mandated California cut it&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The proposition was going to suspend the bill until there were four consecutive quarters with unemployment below 5.5%, something considered a fantasy when the unemployment rate was 12% at the time, and the state had not seen such an extended period of low unemployment in decades. Elsner and his colleagues were fighting an uphill battle against a campaign funded by special interests, most notably major refining companies Valero, Tesoro (now Andeavor), and Flint Hills Resources (a Koch Industries subsidiary). Despite the opposition by special interests, Elsner and his fellow activists helped sustain the Global Warming Act, and Prop 23 lost by an astounding 23% margin in 2010. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After his experience fighting Prop 23, Elsner started a think tank called the Energy and Policy Institute, which acts as a &ldquo;Watchdog exposing the attacks on renewable energy and countering misinformation by fossil fuel interests.&rdquo; The Institute is still active today, and Elsner now serves as a Senior Fellow, after leaving his role as the Exectuive Director to attend graduate school.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While the fossil fuel industry has often fought back against renewable energy, Elsner realized, &ldquo;that industries were leading the way. It was the companies and the trade associations that [he] worked with that were shifting the politics.&rdquo; A favorite story of Elsner&rsquo;s is how on the floor of the North Carolina State Senate, a local Republican politician declared he could not vote against a clean energy bill that helped create jobs in his district. Thus, Elsner realized that </span><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;it was industry that was changing the politics and wasn't politics that was changing industry.&rdquo; </span><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This led to a major directional shift, as Elsner began the transition from policy expert to business leader, while forever remaining an activist. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Elsner then started his MBA at Wharton, where he is currently a second year student. At Wharton, Elsner has made amazing friends and found a large group of extremely motivated professionals from diverse backgrounds. A positive surprise was finding out how many others were interested in cleantech and how much support there is from clubs such as the Energy Club and the Wharton Sustainable Business Coalition. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In his first summer after beginning his MBA, Elsner worked at a corporation that exemplifies the impact one company can have on politics, industry, and national discourse, Tesla. At Tesla, an electric car manufacturer that has pushed every US automaker into moving towards selling zero emission vehicles, Elsner worked in the finance and business operations group. While he loved working at Tesla, Elsner &ldquo;knew that Tesla was going to continue to do great things with or without [him] and [he] wanted to launch [his] own company.&rdquo; Thus ZEV was born, a software company designed to reduce carbon emissions by helping US auto dealerships sell more electric cars.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Elsner re-embraced his childhood love of cars as he realized that while electricity sector was becoming greener every year due to the increasing efficiency and decreasing cost of solar and wind power, the vast majority of Americans were still driving gasoline cars. Elsner&rsquo;s thesis was that most people were not educated about the benefits of an electric vehicle. On top of this, people were worried about the range of vehicles, the availability of charging stations, and the difficulty of servicing electric cars. Because it was hard to find reliable answers to these questions, consumers were uneasy about making a sizable investment in buying an electric vehicle. People worried Thus in its first iteration, ZEV was a &ldquo;service that helps [people] learn about driving an electric car because most consumers are buying them for the first time.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">ZEV accomplishes this by calculating the cost per mile to drive a new battery electric vehicle or plug in hybrid, as well as the cost savings a consumer would realize by switching from his or her current gasoline vehicle. Furthermore, ZEV&rsquo;s software calculates the range implications of making the switch, showing people how far they could drive along their daily commutes, and what charging stations are near their homes. The goal is to help consumers make better informed decisions because Elsner believes that if people understand all the benefits of moving to electric, and their concerns are addressed, they will immediately start making the switch. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">ZEV was initially going to function similar to an Autotrader or True car as a business to consumer (B2C) website that earned revenues off of lead generation for dealerships selling electric cars. However, after talking to experts at business school, and in industry, Elsner realized that the model would not be sustainable. Instead, Elsner decided to take advantage of state level policies that require 10 states (CA, OR, MD, NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA, VT, and ME) to grow their combined cumulative electric car sales to four million vehicles by 2025. Selling so many electric cars has been very difficult, uphill battle for dealerships, and so ZEV now operates as a business to business (B2B) company that provides a software plugin for dealerships. ZEV represents &ldquo;the best product possible that not only helps the dealership salespeople but responds to the end users' needs and &nbsp;provides the best&hellip; and most relevant information to potential EV (electric vehicle) buyers.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Now, car salesmen at dealerships can pull up their website, on which the ZEV&rsquo;s webapp is embedded, and show potential buyers all the perks of moving over to electric. This helps dealerships sell more cars, and increase the number of zero emission vehicles on the road. In fact, on average, a dealership only needs to sell one extra electric car for ZEV to pay for itself, making it a win-win-win-win-win for car manufacturers, dealerships, state governments, the environment, and, of course, ZEV. The company is currently running a pilot program with Philadelphia-area dealerships, and is looking for others to join their upcoming pilots in California, New York, and New Jersey. The company will initially deploy in the California and the tri-state area, then deploy to additional states with EV sales mandates.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For well over a decade, Gabriel Elsner has been fighting climate change, and ZEV is the next step in his long journey of making the a healthier planet for us all.</span></p>",

Dr. Shivani Agarwal, associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania, asks fundamental questions about the design and analysis of these algorithms and finds ways to apply them to problems across several domains. </span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-342e262f-7fff-46fc-870f-7ccc5e2482de\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Before continuing, it&rsquo;s useful to have a general idea of what machine learning is. As paraphrased from the all-mighty Wikipedia: </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Machine learning is a field that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to &lsquo;learn&rsquo; from data, without being explicitly programmed.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Currently, Dr. Agarwal unsurprisingly teaches CIS 520 (Machine Learning) and CIS 620 (Advanced Topics in Machine Learning) at the University of Pennsylvania. Her early love of mathematics is immediately apparent in her theoretical approach to understanding the intuition behind machine learning algorithms. She digs deep into the underlying mathematics that powers them and is definitely not one for hand-wavy proofs. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Outside the classroom, she leads her research group of a few lucky Phds. As Dr. Agarwal recounts how much she loves teaching as well as heading her research group, she says, </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been fantastic.

As an example, in machine learning, there&rsquo;s a class of problems labeled &ldquo;classification problems.&rdquo; We might want to predict what color (or class) a bracelet will turn based on observations of a wearer&rsquo;s mood (we assume that there are finitely many colors). In these types of multi-class problems, the machine learning community used to lack robust measurements for determining the performance of different solutions. Dr. Agarwal&rsquo;s research helps provide insight into how algorithms can optimize for specific performance measures and when certain performance measures are more suitable than others.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Ok, number 2. The problems that machine learning solves are not necessarily that new. There are problems shared across economics and network theory for which interesting solutions lie in machine learning. In particular, Dr. Agarwal discussed a brief example of being able to learn orderings over noisy datasets containing pairwise relationships.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This brings us to number 3 (my personal favorite). Dr. Agarwals&rsquo; research group has made incredible contributions to the life sciences and has impacted real human lives in extremely meaningful ways. Here&rsquo;s the setting for one of her projects: patients with a certain type of colon cancer would sometimes produce an enzyme called KRAS. If they produced this enzyme, they were immediately given a certain drug. Unfortunately, only 30% of these patients would even respond positively to this drug&rsquo;s administration. This meant that 70% of the patients given the drug would go through &ldquo;expensive, time-intensive, and cumbersome treatment with side-effects that don&rsquo;t benefit them at all.&rdquo; So, Dr. Agarwal worked with Mitra Biotech to develop a machine learning algorithm that could predict with 95% accuracy whether or not a patient would respond positively to the drug in question. Today, a variant of this algorithm is being used to help mitigate unnecessary suffering by saving the time, health, and money of those who would not respond well to the drug.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Dr. Agarwal&rsquo;s road to involvement in machine learning started early on. &ldquo;Mathematics has always felt very natural,&rdquo; to Agarwal from a young age. This interest materialized in her pursuing an undergraduate degree<span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"> in mathematics in India,</span> <span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; white-space: normal;\">after which she pursued computer science on&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #222222; white-space: normal;\">scholarship at Trinity College</span></span> in C</span>ambridge. Up until then, she hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea what research even was. Then, at Trinity, she describes, with a light in her eyes, how she &ldquo;met people pursuing PhDs that seemed to keep learning more and more and literally had careers doing this. And that&hellip;that just sounded like so much fun.&rdquo; She then became involved with machine learning research applied to computer vision and then completed her Ph.D. later at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Dr. Agarwal closed out the conversation with a key piece of advice for students on their own paths in life. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;The earlier that students realize that it&rsquo;s not the grades that matter but rather the knowledge that matters, the better prepared they will be for life at any stage. It&rsquo;s very easy to get grades without getting much of knowledge. Knowledge is like this multi-dimensional object that&rsquo;s really colorful with lots of substance in it. Testing, in any form, is just some low-dimensional projection of knowledge. I&rsquo;m not saying ignore grades. I&rsquo;m saying that focusing on knowledge is more important. If you know the full object, then you can handle any projections of it.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>",

Her day-to-day work involves a great deal of business acumen and research across industries, but as a student, Beth&rsquo;s beginnings were in art and design. She went to Temple Tyler School of Arts and majored in photography with a future in art in mind. But unexpectedly, it was in one of her photography classes that she began to learn how to code &nbsp;in HTML, Flash, and animation. Her degree later from the Maryland Institute College of Arts would build further on Beth&rsquo;s progression into web design as she worked heavily in mixed medias with photography, video, and incorporated web and coding as well. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A few years later, a college friend solicited her to build a website for their mom&rsquo;s business - a small children&rsquo;s boutique. From there, Beth found herself doing an increasing amount of work as a freelance website designer. But it wasn&rsquo;t until years later that Beth realized the full potential her website design work could have as a business.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;In 2008, I started to realize that it had been 10 years since I got my MSA, and when I returned home to Philly, I decided that this could really be a business. This could be a viable option.&rdquo; At the time, Beth was teaching art classes at her both of her alma maters, the Tyler School of Arts and MICA, as well as coding class at Villanova University - and for the next 3 or 4 years, she continued teaching while setting the foundations for Blinebury Design.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I had a perfect structure to build my business,&rdquo; Beth reflects, &ldquo;It was really ideal, having a steady flow of income from teaching, which I really enjoyed, but I was also able to slowly grow my business as opposed to diving straight in.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Now, Blinebury Design is thriving, with a hefty client portfolio of designs for clients from international lawyers, wedding industry professionals, to even an opera singer and a private college-preparatory high school. Most of their clients are referrals, with about 95% of their business generated from word-of-mouth. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As for the creative process behind their websites and designs, the first step is finding the clients&rsquo; needs and adjusting the work to their budget. Beth emphasizes that Blinebury has a specific aesthetic and customizable site options, which also factor into their assessment of whether the client and their project are a good fit for Blinebury&rsquo;s team as well. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Once she decides to take on a client, Beth begins a research-intensive strategizing process. She meets with clients and key stakeholders to make sure their branding is aligned. They may also do focus groups with users to figure out site hierarchies and gauge their opinions on the branding of an organization - from how it is perceived, to how it can be changed through design.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to put pen to paper until we have a full understanding of who this organization is,&rdquo; Beth affirms. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">And as opposed to other agencies or designer that may create numerous website mockups, Beth makes sure that Blinebury Design focuses more on presenting one or two quality designs with the most crucial concepts. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;We try to put all the energy in our work hours to really try to take what we learned from our discovery process to create and apply a strategy that we really think will work.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Of course, clients aren&rsquo;t always assured by quality over quantity, and Beth has learned that trust is a key element in design:</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Sometimes clients are very hesitant when they hear that they&rsquo;re only going to get one website concept and assume what they will want is to pick out one from three - and again, that circles back to that sales pitch you need to make to your client and establish trust in the weeks of research that is part of our process.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Having to make business decisions over design decisions sometimes is a common issues design firms often find themselves faced with, especially when in client-based lines of work, and establishing a firmly grounded belief in her designs is what helps drive Beth along the design process:</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;As a designer, part of your job is not just to make a great looking product, but also to sell the client that this design can fulfill your needs, it can help solve your problems. We&rsquo;re not just picking cool fonts and cool colors, there&rsquo;s strategy behind it.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Production will then begin once the client approves of the design. Blinebury&rsquo;s production package includes not only a website product, but client training as well. The goal of client training is a philosophy unique to Blinebury Design, and that is to empower the client to be able to manage the websites themselves. Beth&rsquo;s work doesn&rsquo;t end there, however. Months and years down the line, Blinebury Designs still works with clients to make tweaks and updates to the content and layout of the sites as needed. And as technology changes, and sometimes even the client&rsquo;s company philosophy, Beth makes sure to be there to help them refresh their brand identity. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At the end of the day, there are many things that come with running a two-person business that are less glamorous than the front-end work, from the extremely technical things like accounting and finding your own health insurance, Beth explains. Even taking a week off is a carefully planned process. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all on us to meet client needs and make sure they&rsquo;re happy, even just taking time off is a lot - a week off is crazy. You have to find people to fill in and function as contacts for our clients in the case of any issues and handle any emergencies.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">But this cost is small compared to the benefits that she gains - the reasons why she began her business in the first place:</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazingly freeing to be able to make your own schedule and choose which projects to work on.

There&rsquo;s also the flexibility to choose who you work with, how you work, and when you work - all amazing perks&hellip; Ultimately, I really love running my own business, I love creating this situation for myself to be able to creatively solve problems for my clients.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>",

    "title": "Prioritizing Mental and Physical Well-Being through Fitalyst: Jonathan Muruako",
    "route_name": "jonathanmuruako",
    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In the busy life of a college student, it&rsquo;s hard to juggle the many priorities that include studying, making time for friends, sleeping, and, most importantly, your mental and physical well-being. For many, certain goals and activities will inevitably fall on the back-burner. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for mental and physical health to be one of these back-burner priorities once the pressure of school really kicks in. Jonathan Muruako, currently pursuing a Masters in Public Health from Penn, and Cameo Hazlewood, a senior at Penn studying cognitive science and consumer psychology, are working on a way to take mental and physical well-being off the backburner and put it at the forefront of the college student&rsquo;s mind through Fitalyst.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /></span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Started by Jonathan, Fitalyst is an IOS application with a built-in Facebook messenger bot which attempts to provide individualized wellness packages tailored to a student&rsquo;s schedule, eating habits, goals, anxieties, and more. Jonathan explains,</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> &ldquo;If you ask someone if their health is a priority to them, they are most likely going to say yes. But in reality, there can be a high mental capacity necessary to say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to only eat this type of food, for these reasons, I&rsquo;m going to work out because I want to improve this aspect of my physical health, I&rsquo;m going to set aside this amount of time so I can focus on my mental well-being.&rsquo; Fitalyst tries to relieve the mental capacity required for these actions, making it easier for students to focus on doing the actual activity, rather than planning for it.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Essentially, Fitalyst will utilize some initial information about the user&rsquo;s schedule and habits to form &lsquo;wellness packages&rsquo;, which Jonathan defines as, &ldquo;packages of information that are there for you to use at the most opportune time.&rdquo; A wellness package come in the form of a personalized workout routine delivered to you as you are heading to the gym, or information about how to improve your mental well-being, delivered during your ten-minute break between classes.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">One of the key selling points of Fitalyst is that it&rsquo;s fully integrated with Facebook's Messenger. The wellness packages are delivered through Facebook Messenger messages by the company's&rsquo; flagship product, Tag. Jonathan and Cameo explain, &ldquo;Tag acts as the students' healthy conscience to keep you aspirational for your wellness goals. Through our Facebook messenger chat-bot experience, students can interact with Tag by asking Tag questions and receiving personalized wellness information from Tag. It helps that Tag is on Messenger, because students check messenger more than almost any other application, so it&rsquo;s not like they have to get in the habit of opening a separate application to interact with Tag. They can just interact with Tag as if they were just messaging another friend.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Currently, Fitalyst is still in the mid to early stages of development, with a recent pilot released to a smaller cohort of 100 college students. However, the team is already planning a larger iteration of 1000 college students on the app, before a potential full release in the Spring.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /></span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Jonathan and Cameo also have plans for expanding Fitalyst to encourage partnerships between students and local businesses around college campuses that promote healthy eating and fitness. In addition, they see Fitalyst as a potential tool for increasing communication between different wellness services around college campuses by helping the services better understand the average profiles of students through their preferences on Fitalyst. Jonathan elaborates, &ldquo;It would be nice for CAPS to see that most of their visiting students have these types of schedules, or maybe 1920 Commons can see that lots of people come to eat during this time period after they go to the gym, so they can personalize their service to fit the needs of the students. It should always be free for students, and students should always come first.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Through Fitalyst&rsquo;s progress thus far, Jonathan has learned several valuable lessons. Regarding students who want to launch their own startup or pursue their own unique ideas, Jonathan encourages that they take advantage of resources at Penn. Jonathan remarks,</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think people realize the difference in resources that a college student pursuing a startup has access to versus a graduate pursuing a startup has access to. As a student, there are so many funding opportunities, possible collaborations with fellow students, and more. The second you put that graduation hat on, a lot of the on campus resources are not as easily available because you are not a student anymore.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">He has also learned extremely valuable time management skills. Jonathan has to keep up with several different aspects of his life such as the development of Fitalyst, his college classes, taking care of his health and more. When asked how he manages these different activities, he answered, &ldquo;Everything I do, I do because I know it will bring me closer to achieving my goals. I don&rsquo;t spend time doing things that don&rsquo;t bring me closer to my goals. In my classes, I&rsquo;m learning things that constantly make me re-evaluate the way I&rsquo;m doing things with Fitalyst.&rdquo; Hopefully, Fitalyst will help college students better prioritize their mental and physical health after it&rsquo;s potential launch in the coming spring.</span></span></p>",

There is little other explanation for how a girl dreamed of working for the state department would become the founder of myPlanit, one of New York&rsquo;s hottest tech companies and create the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;contextual data platform&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While running a tech startup was not Meisels&rsquo; initial plan, technology has always played a major role in her life. Meisels started coding when she was 11 on a RadioShack TRS 80, learning using BASIC to program her computer. In the early 1980&rsquo;s, having a computer was uncommon and knowing how to program one was an extremely rare skill, making Meisels an outlier among her peers. Despite her skills at programming, Meisels decided to study biochemistry at Penn, but later turned away from STEM and towards the humanities as she pursued dual degrees in European history in the College of Arts and Sciences and multinational management from Wharton. At the time her plan was to eventually enter the world of diplomacy and international relations after earning a law degree. To save up for law school, Meisels worked as a software developer at Anderson Consulting (now Accenture) and Lotus Development Corp, eventually matriculating to Fordham University in New York for Law School.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">During law school, Meisels took classes all day and moonlighted as a developer to pay for her expenses living in the Big Apple. When it came time to graduate, she had a decision to make: would she go directly into the public sector or make a pitstop in the glamorous private sector to start her career? Meisels&rsquo; had developed a strong mentor-mentee relationship with her best friend&rsquo;s stepmother, the Ambassador to Slovenia, who advised her to &ldquo;Go to a large law firm first and have them train you.&rdquo; This ended up becoming a pivotal decision in Meisels&rsquo; career. In fact, Meisels&rsquo; number one piece of advice for young people is &ldquo;to find mentors in your area&rdquo; because &ldquo;people love to help people.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After four years of working at Shearman &amp; Sterling in cross-border financing law, Meisels realized that she no longer wanted to work in the State Department. After contacting a headhunter, her resume was passed on to AOL which ended up hiring her, and all of a sudden Meisels flew off to the other side of the country, joining America&rsquo;s hottest company in December 2000. At the time, AOL had just been granted FTC clearance to merge with Time Warner creating the world&rsquo;s largest M&amp;A deal worth $165 Billion. The company was on the top of the world and Meisels was leading business development initiatives as a technology license deal negotiator where she worked on partnerships between AOL and the likes of Netscape and McAfee.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The rosy aura of AOL, however, soon dissipated as the dot-com bubble burst, and AOL began being investigated for serious accounting irregularities. Soon, everyone working at AOL was a pariah within the organization and target for dismissal. The SEC contended that AOL overstated revenues by over $400 million in relation to a foreign deal negotiated by colleagues in Meisels&rsquo; team. Soon Meisels&rsquo; saw the SEC and DOJ raid the office; &ldquo;Computers were being taken and scanned,&rdquo; even Meisels&rsquo;. Things were suddenly not looking very good. Layoffs quickly ensued at AOL where large groups of people were called in to clear glass conference rooms. All at once, the whole group would be told they were laid off in mass firings and everyone in the office could see. It was devastating for morale.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After everyone at the Silicon Valley office was relocated to Virginia, AOL&rsquo;s headquarters, Meisels began working on &ndash; and eventually led -- AOL&rsquo;s innovation team, New Business Ventures. There, in 2005, she started working in the technology area (&ldquo;location-based services&rdquo;) that forms the basis of what is now myPlanit. Meisels&rsquo; idea was to incorporate all the data AOL was gathering through search and AIM with GPS locations and MapQuest so that every event you&rsquo;ve gone to, picture you&rsquo;ve taken, or contact you&rsquo;ve met can be associated with a location. All these different AOL assets and others like CityGuide and MovieFone were to come together in a revolutionary new service called the &ldquo;AOL Neighborhood&rdquo;. &nbsp;Meisels worked out a strategy and set of designs to incorporate all of AOL&rsquo;s different data streams, which led to the company receiving five patents, one of which Facebook has acquired and has filed three more based on it. However, by then, Time Warner was strangling all the cash out of AOL and there was no room left to invest in new technologies.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-2053a140-7fff-81a4-9dc5-7c0ec2b91582\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Eventually, Meisels left AOL and would move towards starting her own company that could associate all your activities with a time and place to create &ldquo;the internet of you&rdquo;. Imagine you went to dinner with your friends to a great restaurant and had an amazing bottle of wine you took a picture of. When you&rsquo;re scrolling through your photos you can see the picture and know when you went to the restaurant, and whom you had dinner with. &nbsp;She pitched the idea to a contact at a software firm, who quickly told her to send over an NDA before they went any further. Meisels bootstrapped together a demo of the user interface using animated PowerPoint slides, and the company offered to invest $250,000 in Meisels. Unfortunately, however, that investment fell through when the company&rsquo;s R&amp;D budget was unexpectedly cut. Undeterred, Meisels carried on, suffering two &ldquo;digital miscarriages,&rdquo; as she puts it, with different teams over the years. Meisels is nothing if not tenacious and soon realized that the market was not ready to pay for a consumer application like hers. Instead, it needed to be pitched to business professionals, and she settled on real estate, an industry where location truly is everything.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Now real estate agents can use myPlanit to remember their past, be smarter in the present, and plan their futures. Every time an agent visits a listing, their trip is recorded in the myPlanit app, which remembers what the address was for the pictures an agent took, whom the agent met, what notes were taken about the listing, and even the MLS data on pricing, square feet, etc. In the present, myPlanit can inform agents about all their notes for the client they are about to meet and what properties they have already visited together. Even better, an agent can instantly pull up every home he or she has sold nearby to the property they are currently visiting. For the future, myPlanit hopes to help agents plan meetings, suggest the right client for any given listing, and improve communication between agents and clients by enabling the sharing of actionable data.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Never in a million years did a young Adrienne Meisels predict she would eventually start a tech company building out applications for real estate agents and brokers. Until now, Meisels never even worked in real estate whatsoever. What Meisels always knew, however, was that she loved technology and was undeniably persistent, two key qualities for any successful entrepreneur.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>",

    "title": "Rakesh Vohra - The Best Seats in the House",
    "route_name": "rakeshvohra",
    "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">When we think about the future, we always associate it with uncertainty - the stock market, the next featured entree at NCH, whether or not you&rsquo;re going to pass CIS160, etc. - you know, the usual. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Yet, with Dr. Rakesh Vohra, one of the ECON101 and ESE204 professors brought over from Northwestern&rsquo;s renowned Kellogg School of Management as a PIK Professor specializing in mechanism design, the future is what he specializes in and embraces. It&rsquo;s not something to fear - in fact, it&rsquo;s something that he can predict. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\">Most people have probably heard of the term &ldquo;game theory&rdquo;, and if you haven&rsquo;t, this is the basic premise: given a game with set rules and two players who you assume are going to compete against each other and behave rationally, you can predict the outcome using game theory. What Dr. Vohra does completely flip this idea upside down - </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;Supposing I can design the game that people are going to participate in, and though I cannot control what they do, I can control the rules of the game and use game theory to predict how they will respond to the rules of the game, and that determines the outcome that I might be interested in. For example, how resources are allocated, what kinds of investments do people make. As the planner, how should I design the game to achieve those outcomes?&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">This kind of research has extremely practical applications in the world that we live in today - the AdWords auction system that Google runs as part of its search engine platform is fundamentally connected to mechanism design. The auction is the &ldquo;game&rdquo;, and ultimately Google designs it in a way that maximizes the revenue that they make from the bidders that try to compete for lucrative search words. Dr. Vohra defined these advertisements as &ldquo;complex assets&rdquo;, assets that are far beyond typical things you&rsquo;d find at an art or car auction: </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;There are also complicated assets that you can sell, where your consumption of the asset affects my value - for example, you buying a piece of &ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; or network might affect the way that my network and &ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; works, or bids on supply transport chains for the U.S. Army using trucks, ships, and planes will depend on the people buying them - which path they need, what kinds of trains and planes and ships they need, etc&hellip; It&rsquo;s not enough just to look at the highest bidder; you have to think about how to feasibly combine the bids so that they fit onto the supply chain&rdquo;.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">It&rsquo;s this combination of considering the constraints of the product and the demands of the buyer that creates this interesting, complex equilibrium that everyday consumers never consider. And it&rsquo;s the art of predicting and targeting the balance point of this equilibrium that Dr. Vohra specializes in. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Beyond balancing assets and games, however, Dr. Vohra also balances the responsibilities of teaching classes at Penn as well as his research. In ECON101 (Intermediate Microeconomics) and ESE204 (Decision Models), &nbsp;Dr. Vohra tries his best to be as engaging as possible in his lectures by actively making his students participate in discussion focused conversation; rather than boring students to death with pure, unfiltered information and minimal interaction, Dr. Vohra aims to make his classroom more of a discussion-based learning environment:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I have a philosophy, but I have a preference for doing things a certain way - I prefer discussion and argument, rather than straight lecture. I think that&rsquo;s one of the best ways to learn - it&rsquo;s through discussion&hellip; I think of myself as this - I&rsquo;m trying to set an agenda, so I frame a topic in a way that one can have a concrete discussion, and I&rsquo;d like to manage the discussion so as to push the students to realize &lsquo;oh, ok, this is what&rsquo;s going on, this is the way to think about it&rdquo;. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">With this in mind, however, he also had insightful things to say about teaching undergraduates compared to his prior experiences in the business school at Northwestern. When asked about how he liked teaching at Penn, he offered up a comparison to the types of students he had at Northwestern:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;One thing to keep in mind was that, at Northwestern, I was in the business school, so I was only teaching MBA&rsquo;s, so they were older, more mature, and they were executives; executives are a huge fun to teach - they&rsquo;re probably the best group of students I&rsquo;ve ever had to teach. They&rsquo;re really sharp, they have experience, and they&rsquo;re very curious - the reason they&rsquo;re coming is because they&rsquo;ve faced problems, and they&rsquo;re not looking for answers in the sense of &ldquo;do this, do that&rdquo;, but they&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the way to think about issues that I&rsquo;ve been confronted with? I learned a huge amount from them as I was trying to convince them &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a particular way to look at things&rdquo;, and they&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;no that doesn&rsquo;t make sense, what about this, what about that&rsquo;. I find undergraduates to be far more quiet.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Further on in the interview, Dr. Vohra mentioned one incredibly insightful comment that pretty much summed up his later advice to undergraduates here at Penn: </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the strange thing with undergraduates: the best seats in the house are free, and nobody makes use of it&rdquo;. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Beyond his experiences from the past, however, Dr. Vohra still mentioned how he&rsquo;s still enjoys teaching at Penn thus far. Beyond just teaching courses, he also serves as co-director of the Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences since 2014, around the time of its inception, and has since helped select and advise its first postdoctoral fellows, launch a speaker series housed under the program, and create several grant proposals for further research into the field of networked social/economic/technological systems. When asked about what motivates him to continue teaching and conducting research as actively as he has over the past several years, he responded as such:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;A huge amount is rather selfish. It&rsquo;s simply curiosity - this is one of the few places where you have this opportunity to wake up one morning and say &lsquo;you know what, I don&rsquo;t understand something&rsquo;. And then you ask your colleagues, and then you discover they don&rsquo;t understand it either. And it gets under your skin - then you start digging. The other part is when you learn something new or interesting, you become excited and you&rsquo;re dying to tell other people. And if you have come up with something really fascinating or interesting or surprising, the look on their face when you tell them - that&rsquo;s also amazing.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In a similar vein of thought, Dr. Vohra&rsquo;s advice to undergraduates concerning how they should go about picking a major or deciding what they&rsquo;re passionate about followed the same theme: &ldquo;Do what interests you.&rdquo; Rather than caring about how much you&rsquo;ll be able to make in the future or what other people will think, do what interests you. And if you do that, then everything else will follow. Dr. Vohra himself followed that same path in his undergraduate years when he decided he wanted to pursue something in the field of mathematics at first: </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say there was some grand plan, but there wasn&rsquo;t - I thought I was going to be a mathematician, and then I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t that good[chuckles], so I drifted into other things that seemed interesting. 15 years old, rainy day at school, came across book called Men of Mathematics by Eric Temple Bell, and that was it.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">And even though not everyone will find their calling as Dr. Vohra did at age 15, he still encourages students to pursue their passions; though it may take time, it&rsquo;ll ultimately pay off more in the end. In fact, Dr. Vohra is so engulfed in his own personal passions that he rarely has time outside of his research and professorship duties for many hobbies. And yet, he&rsquo;s far from just a dull academic: he still remains profoundly cultured from the knowledge he&rsquo;s accumulated over the years. Poetry is one reprieve that he personally enjoys (&ldquo;I have too many to pick from if I had to pick a favorite. For genre, I guess I&rsquo;m biased - dead white men up to the Edwardian era of poetry; that&rsquo;s probably me.&rdquo;), as well as regular TV shows like the rest of us mortal Penn students (&ldquo;I like the old Doctor Who&rsquo;s - because the special effects were terrible, so they had to rely on the story to carry it.&rdquo;). Although some of us at Penn tend to forget how human our professors are, it was when talking about palette preferences that Dr. Vohra revealed his true colors: </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&ldquo;In that respect, I&rsquo;m very catholic - I like almost all kinds of foods except seafood - in fact, nothing beneath the water. I&rsquo;ve tried, and I&rsquo;ve never took a liking to it. My friends keep on saying &ldquo;oh, you must absolutely try it when it&rsquo;s VERY fresh&rdquo;, and yes, even when it&rsquo;s been killed in front of me, no[chuckles].&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif;\">Despite my disbelief at his heretic statement of disliking even salmon, the most acceptable of all sushi fishes, there is still much to be said of how passionate Dr. Vohra is concerning his research and teaching; he truly does care for his students and is deeply motivated by the research that he does, which is apparent in all the awards that he&rsquo;s accumulated over the years as a result of these passions. And on that note, here&rsquo;s to hoping that we use those best seats in the house available to us - maybe we can learn an extra thing or two in the process.</span> </span></p>",

An avid sports player, Jessie was, and still is, a hard-headed and ambitious woman. During a rugby game in Lehigh, Jessie fell victim to a rough tackle. The coach did not pull her out of the game. He later apologized, but the damage was already done. Jessie suffered from post-concussion symptoms for six months. Being in college was especially strenuous from this point on -- reading just one page in a textbook took her twenty minutes. Jessie went online to research preventative products. She was unable to find an affordable, easy solution. From that moment, Jessie was determined to provide an inexpensive and reliable way for sports players to know when to tap out. </span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-331ea0d8-7fff-12d1-6af3-226c74065843\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tozuda designs, manufactures, and sells head impact sensors for concussion awareness. The technology developed under Garcia&rsquo;s leadership is able to detect both linear and gravitational forces. Upon a concussion-risk impact, the sensor turns red. Tozuda makes its own plastic injection molding rather than outsourcing, a decision that came easily to Jessie. The calibration accuracy of the sensors needed to be top-notch. Jessie did not want to blow through all her savings, so she purchased a discounted old machine and refurbished it to working capabilities. She calls this her best investment to date. This in-house production model has allowed Tozuda to make and test sensors on demand.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tozuda is primarily aiming to enter the team sports market -- especially helmeted sports. This is currently where the most awareness about concussions lays. Jessie conducted research across coaches in youth leagues. Operating under the fact that only a medical professional can conclusively diagnose a concussion, she found a resounding acknowledgment amongst coaches that they simply want to know when to take a player off the field. With Tozuda&rsquo;s head-impact sensors, it&rsquo;s that easy: if it&rsquo;s red, check your head! The sensor isn&rsquo;t necessarily indicative of an actual concussion, but rather that there exists a substantial risk that ought to be checked out by a medical professional. Jessie emphasizes that she does not want to evoke fear towards sport. She loves sports -- all her best memories come from being a part of a team. In the long term, Jessie envisions Tozuda collaborating with the construction and military industries.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The development of the sensor Tozuda sells today was not a walk in the park. Jessie and her team went through dozens of prototypes and iterations in the effort of finding a reliable way to detect forces without the use of electronics. The biggest obstacle facing Tozuds today, though, is scaling. Jessie confidently declares this to be the hardest part. Completing the assembly work in-house is proving increasingly difficult as demand grows. To tackle this, Jessie is planning on continuing to produce components in-house, but outsource the assembly.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Jessie&rsquo;s advice to budding entrepreneurs is to be well-aware of your abilities and knowledge domains. She almost brought someone to the team who, albeit smart, shared her same exact skillset -- avoiding such inefficiencies is important. Instead, Jessie recommends finding people who are better or more knowledgeable than you in areas that are critical to your startup to fill the gaps. </span></p>",

In your introductory calculus course, a general lecture may follow a simple path of the form, &ldquo;Here is a theorem, here is the proof of the theorem, here is how to use this theorem to solve different kinds of problems&rdquo;. In a class taught by Santosh, a large portion of each lecture is spent motivating the idea behind the topics that will be discussed during the rest of the lecture. These motivations may include historical expositions, intriguing thought experiments, or personal anecdotes. In many cases, Santosh poses questions that directly relate the topic to events that affect our lives every day in both obvious and subtle ways. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">By the time you actually start diving into the work of trying to find an answer to the question, the importance of the question is clear, and you are fully invested in traveling down the path that the problem may lead you. As Santosh guides you to the solution, the answer to the initial question arrives sort of obvious. The rest of the class is spent discussing the implications of our answer, and you leave feeling like you&rsquo;ve learned more than just math. While the lucid style of Santosh&rsquo;s teaching may suggest that his path to becoming a well-known probability researcher and professor was very certain. This is not at all the case.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Santosh grew up in Kerala, a state in South India. While neither of his parents received a formal education, they ensured that he was able to attend school. &ldquo;I was extraordinarily fortunate to be born into a good caste system. My parents weren&rsquo;t really well off. But I had a great childhood.&rdquo; Back then, he didn&rsquo;t spend much of his childhood thinking about math and probability. &ldquo;I would finish all my homework during school so I could come back and play soccer. I played soccer almost every day.&rdquo; Regardless of his parents' financial struggles, Santosh remembers being a very happy child. Santosh recalled a particularly sweet memory from his childhood.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;When I was very little, my grandfather would take care of things behind the scenes when my father was struggling. He would take me out for walks. Once, he bought me peanuts that had just been heated up over a coal fire. This was a real treat. I would eat the peanuts one by one to savor them. But this was a real treat you see, because the street vendor would put these hot peanuts in a small little cone made out of newspaper. So once I ate the peanuts, I would unwrap the cone, and read everything on that sheet. I would read it over and over again until I memorized it. It is amazing how little it takes to keep a child happy.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When it came time for him to attend college, he was admitted to St. Xavier's college. He was asked by a professor at the college to choose one of the following tracks: commerce, arts, or mathematics and science. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;That really flummoxed me. I had no conception of what these things meant. I ruled out business immediately because I am a South Indian Brahmin, and we have no business people in our family. Commerce also sounded vaguely like adding up things under candlelight, and that sounded boring. I had always liked arts, and the tapestries of history. Maybe I could become a writer or a journalist! And math&hellip; I had always liked math. But I had never done anything beyond basic algebra. I mean it sounded neat, I just didn&rsquo;t have much of an idea about what math was. I had heard of Einstein and Ramanujan, and what they did sounded cool. I was in an agony of indecision. I could tell the professor was getting impatient and irritable. So in desperation, I reached into my pocket and found a quarter. I said, &lsquo;heads was math and tails was art&rsquo;. It came out heads. So I chose math. And that's how I ended up studying mathematics.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It&rsquo;s interesting to think that a fair coin flip may have determined one of two very different paths for Santosh&rsquo;s life. However, this uncertainty doesn&rsquo;t bother him. Many of his students have asked him what he would have done if the coin had landed on the tails side. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;So, what! Look. Natural selection has designed us to not be single purpose entities. We are not designed by natural selection to be bayonets. A bayonet has one function: to poke a hole in someone and kill them. We are more like swiss army knife. We are designed by natural selection to do many things competently, and enjoy those things that we do competently. So if the coin had come up tails, I would be teaching history. Worse could happen.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While Santosh enjoyed his first two years of college, the prospect of studying for two more years to get his professional degree hadn&rsquo;t really crossed him until one of his close friends signed him up for the entrance exam for the Indian Institutes of Technology, one of the most well-known engineering universities in India. &ldquo;I went to my chemistry teacher, who told me I should do this. I asked him, &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; He told me it was an entrance exam for engineering. I said, &lsquo;No, no, no&rsquo;. To me, engineering sounded like getting underneath a car to fix it and getting all greasy. I did not like grease. Fortunately, he convinced me to take the test anyways.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Santosh&rsquo;s test scores gained him admittance to IIT. After attending and graduating from IIT, Santosh decided to attend Caltech to study physics and math after speaking with his advisor at IIT. &ldquo;Today, you know, it&rsquo;s foolish. I was operating largely out of uncertainty. I was just going whichever direction life offered me.&rdquo; At the end of his Caltech education, he ended up at Penn to conduct research and teach about topics related to probability theory.</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At Penn, Santosh has focused on a wide range of problems related to probability theory and its applications. These problems range from attempting to answer why our current society is so politically polarized using tools from the theory of spin glasses to trying to figure out how to encode information about a sequence of several Bernoulli trials using one bit of information. One particularly interesting problem Santosh worked on was related to genomic research.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;One day a gentleman by the name of Alon Orlitsky, popped his head into my office and asked if I had a moment to speak with him about a problem in genomics. I didn&rsquo;t have much of a clue about genomics, but it turned out I didn&rsquo;t need to. He was curious about how information is encoded in the genome. Well, I asked him a particularly dumb question. I have a propensity for blurting out dumb questions. I asked, &lsquo;How many folds are there in a strand of RNA?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;Uh, I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;. That wasn&rsquo;t a question a biologist might usually ask, but it was a question a mathematician might ask. So, we started scribbling on his kitchen table. And we had so much fun, we discovered a lot of structure and wrote a paper on it. I think it was published in the National Academy of Science.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Santosh never really felt like he was doing work. From his perspective, he has spent his whole life playing, whether it be playing with a soccer ball or playing with an interesting probability question. This approach to playing has also paid off when teaching his students.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As a teacher, Santosh feels that is very gratifying to share the same sense and enthusiasm and excitement he has about probability with his students. </span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;I enjoy teaching. On a surface level, I am not an incompetent teacher, which helps. But more importantly, there are times when really try to articulate a beautiful concept to a student. Every once in a while, I can see that they see the same beauty in the subject as I do, This is immensely satisfying. If I can make even one student feel this way, then I feel like I have contributed to something.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Santosh&rsquo;s himself admits that much of his life's trajectory was governed on grasping whatever uncertain choices life presented to him. As college students, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what we really want to do. We worry about the fact that walking through an open door may inherently close another door. In regards to these concerns, Santosh provides the following words of wisdom.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s stresses are stresses of choice. If you have no choices, you just have to do what is given to you. Life doesn&rsquo;t owe you a comfortable living. You do what is necessary. This is the way I grew up in. If you have choices, how do you know what to do? The best thing you can do is make the best decision possible given your limited information. Talk to students and researchers in various disciplines, take classes, google search your interests, and talk to your parents.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Lora, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Santosh argues that you should maximize the amount of information you have to work with so you can make the best possible decision. However, he also argues that at the end of the day, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Lora, serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;In situations of choice, the difference between zero and one is infinite. No jobs to one job. The difference is infinite. However, the difference between one and two or more is very large, but bounded. You guys have choices! Remember, we are swiss army knives. Pick something, and do your best at it. Everything will work out. There is no use in pondering about the alternate paths your life could have taken if you made a different decision. And if you find things are at a dead end and you can&rsquo;t seem to make a decision, go ahead and toss that coin.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>",
