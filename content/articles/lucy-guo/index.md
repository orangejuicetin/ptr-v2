Instead of entering her junior year of college, Guo decided to take the [Thiel Fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/), which offers 100k to build on an idea for a year, applying with a hackathon project she pieced together in a weekend.

In her mind, the worst case scenario would be to go back to CMU if the gap year didn't work out and finish her degree. Taking risks is a fundamental part of Guo's regimen. As a founder of the angel investor fund Backend Capital, Guo is constantly making bets and assessing the risk of her decisions. Even at the start of her career, her tolerance for risk and making those leaps of faith seems to be much higher than your average college student.

It's difficult and takes mad confidence to know when you know enough and when you should keep learning. Guo epitomizes the self-confidence of a Silicon Valley founder. Insisting that while it is important to be good at something as a student, skills matter less if you're seeking the entrepreneurship route and leadership matters more.

> PTR: How do you balance focusing on entrepreneurship and building your own ideas while also furthering your own technical skills?

> Lucy: It depends a lot on what you want to do. If you want more in depth knowledge or to be an expert in the field (which is great) it's better to do that at a bigger company. But if you want to build or work on product design or grow an idea, then you need to do your own thing.

Even after only meeting Guo briefly, it is evident that Guo is hyper aware of her strengths and goals. Guo dropped out of CMU and subsequently joining Quora and then Snap as a product designer and recognizes that this was the best path for her. Becoming an "expert in the field" is admirable, but being the smartest person in the room was never an end-goal for Guo. Guo cares more about getting her ideas out into the hands of users and propagating impact.

At her level of success, some might wonder what continues to push Lucy Guo to keep hacking on her projects and regularly adding features. Guo has always dreamt of starting her own business, a direct result of her drive to bring her visions to life. Between the rush of creating a product from the ground-up and the moment a user can interact with it, Ms. Guo found her passion in building. That highest level of autonomy is also why she loved working at Snap in the early years - where Evan Spiegel trusted her and gave her freedom as a designer. It's a part of her that has not changed after all she's done.

From her experience, Lucy's system for building, and identifying talented founders, is centered on speed. While she acknowledges that there is a place for great engineering and taking your time to design something, she emphasizes that the necessity of adapting and implementing your vision quickly. Pointing to the Snapchat and Instagram rivalry for the market, Guo believes that vision can easily be copied. Therefore, in order to win you must be able to consistently work quickly when it counts.

Guo herself tackles building a large project quickly by focusing on a single feature at a time that she personally wants to use. In the context of CampaignWith, Lucy's latest nonprofit platform which allows people to teach online courses to raise donations, that feature was the main landing page. From there, she incrementally releases features and tracks how they gained traction. She notes the importance of making something that people will want to use, to the extent of

Six years later, when the industry and economy looks wildly different, does Guo still recommend this high-risk take to follow your dreams? The answer is a resounding yes. Guo emphasizes that now is the time for students to take risks while they still can, based on COVID's effect on university education as well as the inherent lack of responsibility young people have. Her suggestion is to use the pandemic (if you can) "as an excuse to take a gap year, and to spend it hacking on different projects. If one of those projects gains traction, drop it in as many VC's inboxes as possible." And yes, Lucy cold DM's on LinkedIn, so you should too.

With the overwhelming majority of startups failing, it's hard to imagine that this is a realistic expectation for everyone to follow. But Guo insists that starting a company is not as risky as it seems, for one particular reason: acquisition-hires. These are the safety nets of many charismatic entrepreneurs who have formed a talented team and capital. Guo admits that from the other side of the fence, as an investor, she will often fund teams of talented engineers even if she's not 100% convinced by the idea. If the team is talented and gets enough recognition, they can become hired fairly easily for about the same amount (or slightly less) as the funding they raised. In short, take more "risks" and end up with a worst case scenario of a million dollar comp package served with your big tech offer.

When asked what advice she has for what college students should work on, without skipping a beat, Lucy says that if you have an engineering focus/background, look into "dev tools". Customer facing products are rarer in the yc universe, but Lucy thinks there are 3 hot pain points that give for easy success at the moment: curiosity, saving money, and vanity.

Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat has all been about painting a flattering image of oneself and their lifestyle. However pointing to the rise of Tiktok, which she posits as the intersection of vanity and authenticity, "Gen Z is tired of fakeness... TikTok is less fake than instagram". Guo thinks that canonical social media has done more to make people feel isolated and alone than create a sense of community. Effects that we can see during the pandemic. Guo recalls fondly (almost nostalgically) that when she was young, she would play video games and find a sense of community in her digital worlds. She thinks “next big social media” will be built on nurturing groups that fundamentally address loneliness.

Guo's current favorite social media platform and online community however, is Twitter. With a large online following, Guo uses Twitter for the same reason as VCs, academics, and other tech savants: it's a breeding ground of networking and forming ideas for the next big thing. Guo's feed is currently dominated by posts on her new nonprofit baby, CampaignWith which you can check out [here](https://campaignwith.com/). Although Guo didn't expect to do nonprofit work until her thirties, Guo is happy to have found her "next big thing" and looking forward to what's coming next.
