Closely following the exponential growth of machine learning applications, ethical artificial intelligence policies and studies have become of increasing importance. While mistakes in academic ML range from misclassifying pandas as gibbons or silly typos in NLP strings, biases in industry ML have real and scary implications such as rejecting candidates based on race due to un-normalized training data or targeting in predictive policing. Percepta is an emerging startup aimed to anonymize shoplifting video for analysis. with the goal of building a brand of products that customers will come to value for their emphasis on ethics and reduction of bias.

We recently got the chance to speak with Philippe Sawaya (SEAS '20), co-founder of Percepta, to discuss his experiences with Penn entrepreneurship, navigating the campus' pre-professional culture, and the trajectory of Percepta since graduation. We hope this discussion can help make entrepreneurship feel like a viable path in school (and beyond!).

While taking EAS 546 together, co-founders Philippe Sawaya and Jonathan Mak wondered if there was a way to remove human error and bias from the equation in public safety. Their idea was to eliminate any indicators of race, gender, age, or size from a standard CCTV feed. Instead they wanted to use wireframe images of individuals to detect unsafe situations.

> - CIS 581 and CIS 680 were super helpful in understanding literature and introducing them to the models! (Editor's note: Shoutout to Prof. Jianbo Shi our fave)
> - Philippe notes that his academic background didn't prepare him for cloud computing techniques or managing costs of training the model

### On Mentorship

While the idea gained traction in product pitches, Philippe attributes a lot of their initial and continued success to the guidance of their many mentors. The choice to create market segmentation by focusing on loss-prevention for retails stores was thanks to the help of EAS 545 Professor Vanessa Chan. By connecting them with Walmart execs, Sawaya and his team recognized that there was an market opportunity they had not previously considered. Chan continued to offer guidance while living in Hong Kong, staying up until 4am to hop on a call with the founding team. [insert quote here]

As many of his mentors originated at Penn, Percepta's team had to make some adjustments while working remotely and after graduation. Sawaya philosophy is that the mentorship relationship should be very two-way. In order to value their dedicated mentors, Philippe puts in the effort to be very systematic in his communications. Like a standup, Philippe send weekly emails to his mentors outlining progress made, asking for insight, and current challenges his team faces.

### The Future for Percepta

With \$77k in investment, Percepta is focusing on getting its product ready for launch for smaller venues like the Penn Bookstore. To keep costs low and to make the customer conversion as simple as possible, Percepta is currently using existing hardware and security feeds.

Since June, Percepta has been working within the Pennovation Accelerator, albeit remotely. And while they have not yet connected with the community of other ventures in Philadelphia, Philippe notes that he's grateful for the experience, mentorship, and environment that the Pennovation Center has to offer.

Philippe notes that loss-prevention is not the endgame for Percepta. In the future, he envisions establishing a brand of ethical AI technologies which can be applied to many sectors.

### On the Penn experience

Beyond the great mentors he's found in the engineering professors at Penn, Sawaya believes that one of the greatest resources for aspiring entrepreneurs is the pitch competitions. He met his cofounder Jonathan Mak through one of his previous ventures in an accelerator on campus. But the main draw of doing these practice pitches isn't the prize money or the network, but the feedback on your ideas and chance to practice your delivery, Sawaya says.

In a similar vein, Philippe describes the skills taught in EAS 546 to be really fundamental to what he does now. Cold emailing, pitching to investors, and being trained form ideation to implementation were valuable skills he picked up while in class.

Finally, we asked Philippe on how he handled the external pressures of a Penn community which often puts a tremendous weight on job security than impact. Sawaya admits that he too had plans for a full-time job, pursuing a submatriculate degree, and moving onto a larger tech company. However, he says that the environment around him showed him that route is not necessarily for him. While the future is uncertain and the hours are longer and harder, he and his team are willing to put in the effort to turn Percepta into something and have that sense of impact.
